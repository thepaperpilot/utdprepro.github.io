title: About PrePro
---
PrePro's a club where we showcase our work, collaborating in a team environment, and chilling with friends. On Pitch Day, people with a concept for a game will describe it to the group. We will then vote on which project we want to work on for the semester. Regular meetings after that will be like a studio setting with everyone pitching in their creative talents, whether that be art, music, voice acting, coding, and writing. You can also bring in outside work that you want reviewed and showcased. Overall, the club can give you a chance to work on your portfolio outside of classwork.

Of course, this is all at your own leisure. We don't expect to have a finished prototype by the end of the semester; whatever you can contribute is cool! You are free to come and go as you please, work on whatever and just hang out with friends! Chat it up with fellow members over games, art, dank memes- whatever floats your boat! Not to mention, snacks will be provided!
