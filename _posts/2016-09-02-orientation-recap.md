Welcome everyone to the semester! For those who missed orientation, here's what we covered:

## OFFICERS

This year's officers for PrePro are:

**President:** Caleb Pond  
**Secretary:** Jennifer Moravits  
**Treasurer:** Denzel Buenafe  
**Mediator:** Andrew Ward  
**Webmaster:** Anthony Lawn  

## ABOUT

PrePro's a club where we showcase our work, collaborating in a team environment, and chilling with friends. On Pitch Day, people with a concept for a game will describe it to the group (see PITCH DAY below!). We will then vote on which project we want to work on for the semester. Regular meetings after that will be like a studio setting with everyone pitching in their creative talents, whether that be art, music, voice acting, coding, and writing. You can also bring in outside work that you want reviewed and showcased. Overall, the club can give you a chance to work on your portfolio outside of classwork.

Of course, this is all at your own leisure. We don't expect to have a finished prototype by the end of the semester; whatever you can contribute is cool! You are free to come and go as you please, work on whatever and just hang out with friends! Chat it up with fellow members over games, art, dank memes, whatever floats your boat! Not to mention, snacks will be provided (like today's freshly-baked double chocolate chip cookies~)!

## DISCORD

Outside of the FB and meetings, you can also talk to your fellow club members on our own Discord server! It's like Slack or Skype, but better! We have different channels: general talk, announcements, memes, with more to come! Need help with your portfolio/design or wanna just show off? Post in the showcase channel! Wanna group up with other cool people for games? Check out the games channel! Can't make a meeting but still want to be involved? Make some new friends on the server! The link is over here -> https://discord.gg/0wDw1ntMDZpm2hA5

## PITCH DAY

Pitch Day, as we said above, is the big day when you guys dazzle us with you awesome and creative game concepts. Some things to include in your pitch are:

- Basic Mechanics/Gameplay
- Genre
- Art direction/style
- Story summary
- Scope

If your concept is selected, congratulations! You are now the Creative Director for the semester! You will then create a more in-depth design document with what assets you want and elaborating on what you had originally pitched. This also begins our T-shirt contest: artists can come up with designs for our club t-shirt. Imagine your project and your art on people's shirts- how awesome is that? Pitch Day is in two weeks, so designers start planning!

## GAME DAY

Next week is Game Day, where anyone can bring in board games and video games to play with other members! Food, as always, will be provided! We have another Game Day around Halloween, and we will have our End-of-the-Year Outing closer to the end of the semester.

If you have any questions, feel free to send any of the officers an email! See you next week!
