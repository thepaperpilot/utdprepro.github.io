Welcome newcomers to PreProduction Collaborative! We're a club that meets weekly to work collaboratively on the preproduction step of making a video game.

##### Pitch Day

At the beginning of every semester we'll have a day where anyone can present their idea for the game the club will work on that semester! Here are some things to include in your pitch:

- Basic Mechanics/Gameplay
- Genre
- Art direction/style
- Story summary
- Scope

Ideally, these would be presented either a powerpoint or design document, the latter of which you can see an example of [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/107fZhJi9IeexC_kS7h-lza4mn-7zUPgsJdleXpzwzA4/edit?usp=sharing). 

##### Game Days

Our club also has regular game days, which are days where instead of working we just have fun socializing and playing games. Everyone is encouraged to bring their controllers and board games for a casual night of socializing and fun!

##### Links

At the bottom of the page is a set of links. The facebook and discord links are to groups where you can talk to your fellow club members. The google drive link brings you to a folder where you can see all of the preproduction assets, and submit your own. The email link is there for anyone that needs to contact the current web master, and the feed link brings you to an RSS feed of all anouncements.
