The skills Val can use in battle can be found in the Skills page, with 4 branching paths within the Skill Tree. The first branch is the ACT branch; skills in this branch increase your attack power as well as unlock stronger attack skills. The FOC branch boosts MES recovered when meditating as well as unlocks healing skills and Virtue-changing skills. The defensive tree, the RES branch, lets you use status blocking skills as well as create in-battle shields that weaken enemy attacks significantly. The final branch is the AGI tree which focuses on increasing speed, evasion, and adds status inducing skills.
