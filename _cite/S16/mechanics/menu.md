The menu can be accessed from the overworld at any time. Within it, a panel displaying Valâ€™s stats are available for you to see as well as Skills, Items, Bestiary, Map, Options, and Return to Main Menu. The Skills page lets you see all of the skills you have learned as well as look at the Skill Tree so that you spend skill points. The Items page lets you look at your inventory, both with in-battle use items, equipment, and key items. The Bestiary contains all of the enemies you have encountered as well as their stats. The Map shows you both the world map and local map as well as the location of yourself, items, and entrances/exits. The Options page allows for you to adjust graphics and audio. Returning to the Main Menu lets you go back to quit the current saved game.
