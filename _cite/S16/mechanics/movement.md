Movement in the overworld is done from an top down view similar to Super Mario RPG, where you can move around the map, entering and exiting areas, and encountering enemies which appear as single sprites. Running into these sprites immediately start a battle between one or more foes. Other objects you can interact with are NPC humans, peaceful spirits, treasure chests, switches and levers in certain areas, and save points which also serve to heal you.
