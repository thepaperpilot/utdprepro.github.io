Mechanics call for keyboard controls, with optional mouse interaction. Movement in overworld include arrow keys/WASD with inputs for diagonal movement and/or analog stick, and a button for interaction, default is X. For menu navigation, Enter pauses the game and opens the menu. Arrow keys/WASD to navigate, X for confirmation and Z for canceling. Menu controls are also used in-battle with reaction-based critical attacks. Mouse movement can be substituted for selection movement when navigating menus and battles.
