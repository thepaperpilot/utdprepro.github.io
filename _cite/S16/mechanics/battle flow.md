### Initiation

Initiative determined by AGI stat; a graphic showing turn order appears on top, also determined by AGI

### Player Turn

Choose between Act(Offensive Skills), Tactic(defend for a turn, flee), Meditate(Heal, Defensive Skills, Stat Changing), or Item.

- **If Act or Meditate chosen** Critical timer bar appears with green area, size of which is affected by FOC stat; if confirm key is pressed at the right time, critical hit- increased damage or added negative effect, increased healing or added positive effect

- **If Act hits Enemy** Enemy has short moment (half a second or less) following attack hit to react; if reaction is true, then damage dealt with be lessened or status effects are less likely to occur, or some counterattack will be done to the player

### If Enemy Turn

No enemies have an Item, so will choose either Act, Tactic, or Meditate.

- **If Meditate chosen** Enemies will not have a critical timer bar.

- **If Act chosen** Critical timer bar appears with green area; randomly choose when to attack; if hit within the green area, critical hit

- **If Act hits Player** Player has short moment (half a second or less, can be increased with AGI stat) to react, visual or auditory cue will be given; if timed right, reaction where damage dealt will be lessened, lower chance of negative status effects occurring, or Val deals a counterattack

### End

Battle ends when either the player has run out of HP, the enemy has run out of HP, or either Val or the enemy flees.
