Death is the ultimate mystery, with people holding on and coming back to life while others move on into the afterlife. In that split second decision, what if you choose neither life nor death? Welcome to Limbo, a mysterious and gloomy dimension where hostile spirits lurk about and your Virtues manifest as magic, a place where how good you are as a person is judged by whether you survive or not.

Play as Val as she tumbles head first into Limbo and fights her way back home, saving a civilization of diverse and quirky characters from imminent destruction under the Founders along the way. Featuring a unique twist on the traditional RPG battle system as well as an art style that hearkens back to the PS and N64 era, prepare to wise up and take action: welcome to Ennea.
