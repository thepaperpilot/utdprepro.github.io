The headmaster of the Thunder Tribeâ€™s academy, this snappy woman is the reason why so few are excelling while so many others are breaking down and crying, creating an unforgiving curriculum where only geniuses can succeed while everyone else is forced into labor in the clockworks. Lazy herself, she prefers to let the others do her work for her, unwilling to help the citizens.
