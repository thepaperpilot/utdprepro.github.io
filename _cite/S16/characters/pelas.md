Young, spry, and enthusiastic about everything, Pelas is your typical annoying 1st grader. He tries to get Val to break out of her shell and excited to Understand the world of Limbo, with limited success. He catalogues the hostile spirits of Limbo in the bestiary. His researcher parents rely on him for food and household chores.
