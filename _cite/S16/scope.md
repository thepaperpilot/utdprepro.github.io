The project would be a medium-sized undertaking, very much feeling like an indie game with art and mechanics trimmed down to the basics. On the other hand, the assets required as well as story are very fleshed out but a balance between battle and exploration would be fantastic. The best situation is to have some concept art, a refined battle system, and a clear main plotline fleshed out by the end of the semester. The roles required would be:

- **Concept Artists** for enemies, characters, and the environment. With 11 areas in total, consisting of a small village and 2 dungeons, there many opportunities for artists to draw their own flora, fauna, and designs. The enemies are all based on various pitfalls of human nature like Procrastination and Bad Tan Lines, so artists are free to let their imaginations fly!

    - **Water Tribe (Understanding)** beaches, jungles, Indian/Polynesian aesthetics

    - **Dark Tribe (Loyalty)** swamps, mushrooms, Iroquois/Ethiopian aesthetics

    - **Light Tribe (Joy)** desert, glass, Mali/Navajo aesthetics

    - **Fire Tribe (Courage)** volcanoes, charred forests, Medieval European aesthetics

    - **Nature Tribe (Harmony)** forests, wild animals, Northwest Coast/Aztec aesthetics

    - **Ice Tribe (Just-ice)** tundra, taiga, Inuit/Nordic aesthetics

    - **Earth Tribe (Kindness)** caves, mountains, Persian/Japanese aesthetics

    - **Thunder Tribe (Diligence)** steampunk, mechanical city, Victorian aesthetics

    - **Air Tribe (Integrity)** cloud mountain tops, Incan/The Capitol aesthetics

    - **Spirit and Metal Tribes (Faith and Temperance)** plains and wasteland, no aesthetics as the Founders killed the nomadic Spirit Tribe and assimilated the Metal Tribe

    - **Chaos and Order Tribes (Hope and Patience)** futuristic sci-fi city and ancient Roman/Egyptian ruins; people deported

    - **The Founders** the villains, buildings in industrial modernist style, Americana aesthetics

- **Storyboarders** for writing out the script and dialogue. There is expected to be at least 4 main chapters, each encompassing 3 lands. As linear as the game is, the story writers have a unique challenge of presenting the different Virtues each tribe represents while still pushing Val onward in her journey.

    - **Chapter 1** Water, Dark, and Light

    - **Chapter 2** Fire, Nature, and Ice

    - **Chapter 3** Earth, Thunder, and Air

    - **Chapter 4** The Lost Tribes and the End

- **Game Designers** for refining the battle mechanics and the user interface. Because Virtue, the HP, is a modifier for attacks AND defense, it becomes tricky in battle to make sure neither the player is too strong nor too weak. In addition, we will need game designers to create maps for the various dungeons.

    - Battle System

    - Level Design

    - UI

- **Sound Design** for composing music and adding sound effects
