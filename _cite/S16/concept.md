## Game Concept

Ennea is a turn-based RPG game where you control Val through her journeys in Limbo, moving around in a 3D environment. A unique system reliant on Virtues, which acts as both your HP and stat modifiers, allows you to cast magic and fight against the numerous hostile spirits that roam the island. By building Virtue, you are better able to get these enemies to recognize the error of their ways and peacefully move on. Strategy is key to winning any battle in Ennea. Outside of battle, Ennea is an exploration of human personalities based off of the Enneagram, talking to the Islanders over the virtues they follow and how it can both make a person great or terrible based on how they act on them.
