Even though they lived on the same land, the Metal Tribe settled in small stationary villages alongside the Spirit Tribe. Since they did not get to move when times were bad, they constantly struggled to gain enough resources for the whole year. Economic with resources and words, the tribe was focused solely on balance, never letting one ideology or resource dominate the tribe. Such a rough and tumble attitude of “doing whatever it takes to survive” does however make it easy to justify criminal activity, part of the balance between good and evil within the tribe.
