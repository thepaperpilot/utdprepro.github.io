The Order Tribe disliked change beyond all else or in general being in a position which they werenâ€™t comfortable with. By restraining their desires, they live repetitive and comfortable lives guarding the ruins of the Ancient Capital, keeping alive the history of the Islanders. Their love of tradition however often times masks inertia and laziness, deeming change as too much work. Their patience prevents them from taking the initiative, instead waiting "for when the time is right" when it might not ever come.
