The peaceful Nature Tribe lives one with Limbo’s nature… kind of. Vegetarians who seek not to harm any living thing, their way of life is easygoing and lax with relatively plentiful food and peaceful spirits all around to protect them. They’re quick to forgive and forget, and tend to treat everyone equally. Such a way of life leaves them sensitive and emotional when things go wrong, and as such they are the first to fall prey to feelings of hopelessness.
