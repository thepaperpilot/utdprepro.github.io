The Air Tribe is, above all else, eccentric. Everyone is urged to do "their own thing,"" giving them the freedom to pursue whatever they want. The idea of being a unique individual is of great importance to them- being told that they are "not original" or "lacking personality" is like a slap to the face. Many become artists and performers or engage in strange hobbies. Despite the variety, they are prone to being a jealous bunch, envying what talents another may have.
