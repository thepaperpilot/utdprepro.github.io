An entire clan of busybodies who dwell in the cityscape of their homeland. Their society despises being worthless and so prioritize diligence and hard work above all else. The higher your place of power or the more famous you are, the better, leading many to becoming inventors and merchants. However, they are prone to losing themselves to the desires and expectations of others, deceiving themselves and others about their true nature and intentions.
