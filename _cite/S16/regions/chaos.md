The Chaos Tribe was the tribe of starstruck dreamers, ever optimistic and determined to deal with whatever life threw at them. Unlike the Water Tribe who was too busy studying and the Thunder Tribe who only built only if it would bring them recognition, the Chaos Tribe took the opportunity to explore the possibilities of magic and science, building a metropolis with tech that defied physics. However, their propensity for being whimsical and fickle meant that many led rather aimless lives doing only whatever they liked at the moment.
