This tribe lives underground with tunnels carved deep into the mountains, mines running far below. Their value of kindness allows them to be more freely giving amongst their clan, though rarely with other tribes. Family- and society-oriented, most Earth tribesmen live well if not very exciting lives. Their generosity has its drawbacks, with excess luxury rampant amongst all classes while the poor sacrifice their earnings for family and others, hoping that it will earn them love and friendship (and occasionally donations).
