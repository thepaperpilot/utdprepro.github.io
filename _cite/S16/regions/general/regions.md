There are 11 areas of the game minus the intro corridor and final dungeon, each corresponding to a miniboss/boss. Each region has a minor dungeon (the lands around the village), a major dungeon (where you fight the miniboss/boss), and generally a village.

There are a total of 10 villages over the course of the game, 9 for each of the first areas and the rebel’s camp functioning as the village in the final chapter. Each village has a shop, a crafting area, a save point, and a few NPCs who can give out quests. These can range from gather, kill, and fetch quests and reward Val with Virtue, items, or a stat boost.

The type of enemies found in a region coincide with the Vice the local tribe is weak against, ie Pride elementals found in the Ice region.

The minor dungeon is where most quests will take place, and are easy to navigate for the most part. Think of these as the dungeons connecting 2 areas like in the Zelda games.

The major dungeons are more puzzle oriented than the minor dungeons. Much of the level design is to discourage the Islanders’ virtues or take advantage of them, like the Water dungeon might take advantage of the curiosity of the tribe by placing traps in chests.

The exceptions to the one minor, one major dungeon per area are the plains area and the Capital area. The plains region’s “minor” dungeon contains puzzle elements you would find in a major dungeon, in a way having 2 major dungeons. The Capital area instead has 2 major dungeons and no minor dungeon.
