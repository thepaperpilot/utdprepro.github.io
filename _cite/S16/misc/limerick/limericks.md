**Concept:** To get people interested, we can design posters depicting characters from the game and have these limericks so they get the creepy yet cartoony vibe.

Timid young Val is no leader
and in Heaven she is no believer.
‘Twixt the plane’s crashing noise
and her mom’s worried voice,
Torn between life and death- she chose neither.

Sundyu tries not to be selfish;
His love for the forest’s quite elfish.
But it’s turning to rubble
and his tribe is in trouble-
He’s their leader, and he’s only twelve-ish.

For Coriol, music’s her passion;
She might also be into fashion…
But she’d better pick soon-
Hunger’s inopportune
since she’s all out of food to ration.

When anxious, Nakit feels much better
writing her suspicions in letters.
Though she was not prepared
to have her concerns shared-
Now the mafia’s out to get her.

Arco studies hard, hits the gym,
extracurriculars filled to the brim.
He’s dying, quite frankly,
Pressured by his family
To be perfect or else they’ll disown him.

Argena watched the first war erupt,
Only one her tribe not corrupt.
She watched her love slaughtered
and also their daughter;
Now she waits for her past to catch up.

Gobe hardly ever feels down
His laughs’ volume knows know bounds.
So it’s rather concerning
that his family’s not yearning
when they find out he hasn’t been ‘round.


Marbelle’s life seems like perfection,
surrounded by her family’s affection.
But with wages declining,
she spends more time mining-
Now she’s struggling to maintain connections.

Fyord had known deep down inside
in keeping the Code, Founders lied.
He does have his doubts
of what will win out:
His tribe’s honor, their hunger, or pride?

Pelas, “Great Explorer,” runs free;
His parents, most times, leave him be.
Two researchers absorbed
in their work had ignored
The guards coming by for the “fee.”
