In regards to aesthetic, the world of Limbo is gray, gloomy, and supernatural. Colors are dark or desaturated except in areas where the Islanders live, each with their own associated color palette and patterns. The art would best be done in a stylized cartoon look along the vein of Legend of Zelda: The Windwaker with a twist of Tim Burton. The modeling of the characters would be lowpoly, with the textures and animations imitating the aesthetic of N64-era games.
