The world itself is barren, the sand wiped away most signs of life. However, the world isn’t completely empty. Creatures that adapted survived. So the world is a planet of survivors. The creatures that survived should fit into an arid environment. The colors aren’t verdant and are not too vibrant, but that doesn’t mean the the colors can’t be varied or interesting. Color should be used for emphasis and be striking. Refer to the color scheme document for a base idea of the colors of the game. The ruins themselves draw influence from persian architecture. Think grand structures that stand resolute against time. The technology should influence the design.
