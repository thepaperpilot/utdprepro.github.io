[The Different Shades of Sand](http://adobe.ly/1FISLAe)

[Ruins Color Scheme](http://adobe.ly/1MkpyQH)

Here is the color scheme for the sand and for the ruins. This is just for those two things so feel free to use other colors for other things but if you do try to make sure that it is cohesive or fitting.

The different sand colors relate to how the sand would look in shadow or brightly lit in the sun.

The red in the ruins is meant to be a metallic copper of some sorts.
