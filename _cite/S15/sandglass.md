A dune surfing 3d platformer with emphasis on momentum management skillfully maneuvering the environment.

##### Mechanics

In this game you explore the ruins of a lost civilization, their remnants landmarks in the barren desert. You explore these by surfing the sandy dunes, avoiding ruins and traversing obstacles. The goal is to make it to the end of the level, preferably gathering collectibles on the way to the bottom. The main challenge of the game is through proper use of the games controls. You control the character directing him to ramps, and avoiding pits, trying to keep momentum high while searching for collectibles. After each major section of gameplay there will be a pyramid level. This level is intended to test the player’s knowledge of the game’s mechanics and unlike the other sections will be on a timer. If you fail to keep moving quickly enough you will fail that level.

##### Story

The ruins of the lost civilization contain powerful artifacts, and lost technology. This technology is extremely advanced, all of its secrets are lost to time. It is so advanced that it may as well be magic. Some sections of the ruins may have effects that counter normal laws of nature, such as space or gravity. You can retrofit collected tech that allows the last bastion of civilization, your home, to survive. You are your village’s last hope for survival.

##### Aesthetics

The game will contain a lot of sand. The sand will be broken up by rocky ravines, crumbled pillars, and ruined structures. The ruins draw their base look from Egypt, however their look is augmented by the advanced technology. Think sandstone and crystal energy conduits. I like the idea of minimalism or doing a lot with little. The game should contain striking color for interesting aesthetic highlights and variety in the scene.

##### Scope

Each level is linear and directed. The experience should be compact and well thought. Each level contains careful placement of objects that make the most of the small space. In addition to this there will be little or no backtracking, so level designers only have to think in one direction.

##### Team Requirements

3 level designers, 1-2 systems designers. 3-4 Environment Designers, 2-4 Concept Artists, 1 rigger, 1 animator, 2-3 Modelers/Texturers, 2-3 Programmers

Minimum Total Team Size: 15-21
