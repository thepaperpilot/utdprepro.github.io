My idea of what the player looks like is a vague concept rather than a defined aesthetic so all that I can describe is how the character feels. To me the main character is an intrepid explorer uncovering mysteries. This doesn’t mean the character is necessarily noble however he is at least brave to be exploring these ruins. He doesn’t view himself as a hero or as a saviour to his village however, he does want to help. The player is driven by his fierce curiosity to uncover the mystery of the ruins as well as wanting to help the village. Since I can’t really describe how the player looks I will have to resort to pictures. The thumbnails that Andrew provided came surprising close to the image in my mind. This doesn’t mean that the main character has to look like this, however what should be taken away from these images is the tone or feel. Each of the characters presented here look like explorers. They seem brave or dynamic. If anything could be taken from these visually its that I always had the image of the tattered cloak in my head. Hopefully this helps clarify what I think of the characters visual style. If you can keep the visual tone of the character similar to this anything is really fine by me. Please experiment.
