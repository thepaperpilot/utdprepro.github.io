##### Movement

In SandGlass the player navigates through sand dunes using boots using the artifact technology. While surfing you will have to avoid/interact with the ruins, keeping your momentum high while doing so. The main challenge of the game is through proper use of the games controls. You control the character directing him to ramps, and avoiding pits, trying to keep momentum high while searching for collectibles.

> Maybe also prosthetics made using artifact technology, but Character Design is working that out.

> collectibles need a mechanical benefit as opposed to just intrinsic value. or they need to be removed

##### Controls

- A: Jump

- Forward Left Analog: Accelerate

- Backwards Left Analog: Decelerate

- Right Analog: Camera Control

- X: Interact

##### Obstacles

Walls: Impede the player’s progress and slow them down if not avoided properly.

Pits: Pits that the player needs to jump over. They are of varying sizes and should be placed in conjunction with walls and other obstacles to increase the difficulty of traversal.

##### Goals

Artifacts: There is the final artifact at the end of the level that is the player’s goal. Basically the victory state for each level.x

However there should be smaller artifacts that the player picks up during the level.
