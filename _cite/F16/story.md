Back in the times of yore there was an ancient evil. This evil was called Ahriman. Ahriman was  powerful that no single god could stop him. However 6 of the weaker gods banded together into a council, a pantheon if you will and drove him back, draining him of his strength until he was all but defeated. In one last desperate act Ahriman expelled his soul and possessed one of the council unbeknownst to the other five. Seeing the benefit of cooperation the council was upheld even after Ahriman was “defeated.” During this time of prosperity Ahriman secretly plotted his revenge against those who had wronged him, and after centuries of preparation Ahriman revealed his scheme to the council enslaving each of them to his will. This betrayal brings a dark time on the people of our story.

Ash’ra is the last remaining priestess of the Silk Guardians, the rest of her sisters has been wiped out by stone incarnations of the enslaved gods, which were in the form of titans. All but the high priestess, Ash’ra’s master Pad'ua were killed. Pad'ua was gravely injured however and used her last remaining power to inhabit the temples most treasured artifact: The silken bag. Pad'ua uses her life force to enhance the magical properties of the silk the bag creates and affords Ash’ra more control over the silk. Ash’ra must now venture forth on a holy quest to purify the enslaved gods through their physical embodiments. Once purified Ahriman’s control of that god is relinquished. She must do this by encasing them in the holy cloth that the silken bag creates. To do this however, Ash’ra must venture forth into the desert, lands unknown, and fight the god’s servants and then the gods themselves. The fate of the planet lies in her hands.

### The Player Character

Ash’rah is a strong warrior priestess who is tasked with the protection of the world against great evil. She is the last of a noble line of protectors. The priestess order called the silk guardians.

### The Foe (Shadow)

Ahriman is the biggest evil out there however Ash’ra cannot reach him. Her influence only extends to the things on the physical which Ahriman is not. The enslaved gods and their minions oppose Ash’ra via physical force. Ash’ra will have to kill the minions to get to the gods and purify them so that they are no longer under Ahriman’s control.

### Other Characters

Ash’ra’s master Pad'ua can speak to her through the magic bag. Pad'ua is not truly dead, she has just taken on a different form via soul transference. Other than Pad'ua and maybe the gods there will be no other speaking characters in the game.

### Story Vehicles

Hieroglyphs. Magic artifacts that contain the story? Pad'ua could absorb the information and narrate it to Ash’ra while painting a picture of the story with silk.
