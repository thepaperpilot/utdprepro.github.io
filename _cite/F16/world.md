The player would fight each titan in a different area. The change in area would change the method in which the player climbs or ties up the titan. For example if the player was fighting in a canyon that was the titan’s height it would benefit them to climb the canyon first as the canyon doesn’t move and then jump on the titan from there. Alternatively, maybe you’re fighting the titan in a plain, so you have to figure out how to tie them up without anything but the titan to climb on. Other notable environments are inside a huge cavern, under water (no idea how that would work but it would be cool), and or in the sky (if we wanna be cliche and have a bird titan). This is more of an aesthetic thing but it would be awesome to have monuments built into the cliffside.

### Key Locations

The temple would be a key location but unless the player is given a reason to return they wouldn’t ever bother. Besides that the key locations are the areas where the titan fights take place (the ones mentioned above).

### Game Flow

The player will head out to defeat a particular titan and then the player will return to the temple and then head out in another area that was unlocked after they defeat a titan. The second option sounds cool but may push the game even closer to Shadow of the Colossus.

### Interactivity

The player can pin silk to the environment and the titans. The player can attach silk to outcrops and swing on them. Besides the titans themselves the world will be pretty static.

### Training

A training room where the player can learn key combos and attacks. This could be a separate level however it would be more immersive to just have it be room in the temple (this requires the world to be the second structure mention in the game flow section). Maybe something similar to the kung fu panda training room. It should also allow the player to practice platforming.

### Map/Layout

To be created (probably not by me)
