##### Chapter 1

###### Cutscene 1

- Tapestry depicting history of the gods fighting Ahriman
- Day-night cycle- see light pass on tapestry to show passage of time
- Gods become corrupted one by one- daylight fades and stays dark, torchlight
- Final Goddess of Priests gets corrupted, shadows move around, monster shreds tapestry, bloodstains as the priestesses get slaughtered
- Tapestry drifts down, lands at the feet of Ash’ra, the last Silk Guardian
- Weapon in hand, she seeks out for any surviving members of her order in the Guardian Sanctum

###### The Guardian Sanctum

- Ash’ra needs to clear out the minions out of the sanctum (Goddess of Priests minions) and find surviving Guardians if any
- First section- introduce movement controls like climbing, running, wall jumping, and swinging; Ash’ra sees signs that a person might still be alive
- Second section- introduce the combat mechanics; Ash’ra finds the journal of her mentor Pad’ua talking about the attack; the last entry was only a few days ago, talking of how she’s decided to use the Sacred Silk Bag from the sanctum vaults and then purify the corrupted Titans
- Third section- reinforce learned mechanics, introduce Titan-fighting mechanics; Ash’ra finds the Sacred Silk Bag and takes it; in the next room she finds the wounded body of Pad’ua. She however is controlled by corrupted silk strings and is being puppeted around by the Priest Goddess. Ash’ra must use her purifying silk magic to release her master from the corruption.

###### Cutscene 2

- Wounded but still alive, Pad’ua uses the last of her magic to transfer her soul into the Sacred Silk; she urges Ash’ra to take on her mission to free the Titans, despite the internal conflicts she has.
- At Pad’ua’s liberation, the sanctum’s corruption is wiped away; Ash’ra is now free to explore the world
