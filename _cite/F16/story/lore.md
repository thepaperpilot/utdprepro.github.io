### Origins of the World (lore found scattered in Guardian Sanctum)

- [The Origin Force] created the World; from its body came forth the Pantheons of the world
- Each Pantheon was assigned to a section of the World. Some areas received 2 conflicting gods; some received 3 or four gods working together; still others only received one patron; this large stretch of desert got SIX.
- The gods and goddesses all had conflicting ideas on how they would shape their region: Merchant wanted the people to trade salt with other nations; Farmer wanted to just grow crops and farm livestock; Artisan wanted people to just manufacture and produce art; Warrior wanted to build a powerful military; Servant wanted the most progressive law/government system; Priest wanted everyone to just worship them
- The region remained divided for a long time- each God more or less ruled a section of the world and remained weak

### Ahriman and the Triumph of the Gods (lore found scattered along the Daiti River)

- Ahriman was a foreign god from a region with conflicting gods; He was kicked out of his land and He and his followers decided to find a new land to control
- Upon coming to the desert, He noticed how weak the area’s gods were and decided that this would be the perfect location.
- Ahriman’s followers raided the land, sacking villages and terrifying the locals. The people sent out a cry of help to their Gods.
- Hoping that by defeating Ahriman by themselves, each God hoped to prove their ideology the superior among the others.
- When they each faced Ahriman one-on-one, they were defeated. Alone, they were too weak. They hid away, ashamed, underneath the Lake of Tears.
- The Six realized that their defeat was caused by their lack of power divided. Now, they devised a plan to fight him, but together as a group.
- To do so, they organized all of their followers and asked them to worship them all as a Pantheon rather than just having one patron god. By increasing the faith they received, they grew in power.
- With the 6 gods and their people united, they faced off against Ahriman and his followers at the Scar. It was a long battle, but all of Ahriman’s followers were defeated and Ahriman himself was destroyed.
- The desert safe at last, a golden era dawned, where cities grew, trade flourished, art and culture bloomed, and abundant food meant hardly anyone went hungry. 

### The God of Warriors (lore found scattered in the Scab, the Temple of Warriors)

- The God of Warriors wanted a nation that could defend itself
- He created the Scab, a volcanic region, so that his people could harvest the tough granite for building walls and forts and sulfur for creating gunpowder.
- The God believed in the “eye-for-an-eye” mentality when it came to justice, and often butted heads with the peaceful Goddess of Servants.

### The Goddess of Servants (lore found in the Crowns, The Temple of Servants)

- The Goddess of Servants intended on creating the most progressive, peaceful, and efficient government in the world.
- The Crowns served as both a defensible location for the capital that can easily be supplied with water, food and minerals despite its relative isolation.
- She wanted to minimize punishments for crime, instead focusing on eradicating the root of the matter; the God of Warriors was not pleased by this.

### The God of Merchants (lore found in the Merchant’s Fingers, The Temple of Merchants)

- The God of Merchants originally wanted the people to invest in global trade; since the desert was so barren, He thought that it would be best to import most of their goods in exchange for salt.
- To this end he created the Palm Sea so that the desert would have a port with access to the ocean as well as the Merchant’s Fingers so that the people could harvest the lucrative mineral.

### The Goddess of Farmers (lore found in the Sinking Gardens, The Temple of Farmers)

- The God of Farmers wanted the desert to be self-sufficient in producing food, growing their own crops and raising livestock.
- He created drought-resistant flora which then covered the Green Crowns and the Daiti River with forest; the lands become fertile, and the inland delta known as the Sinking Gardens began flourishing with wildlife.

### The God of Artisans (lore found in the Golemforge, The Temple of Artisans)

- The God of Artisans saw the desert people as those who could create great wonders and wanted to maximize that creative potential.
- He hewed the Golemforge’s canyons, creating awe-inspiring landmarks in stone, glass, metal, etc; these materials could then be used for sculptures, tools, ceramics, etc.
- He began the Grand Mural so that the land would have a Wonder that people could come marvel and visit.

### The Goddess of Priests(lore found in The Sand Loom, The Temple of Priests)

- The Goddess of Priests had planned for the people to unite together in worship of all the Gods- problem was that the Gods were so divided that the people’s worship was split as well.
- The Sand Loom was created as a place of meditation; those seeking enlightenment can go to the Qoqun Oasis, separated from the world, marvelling at the magic of the rainbow sands.
