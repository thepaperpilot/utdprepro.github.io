- At end of canyon, entrance at its former edge; as time passed, temple expanded and dug into to expand area of lore
- Corrupted- murals and statues come to life
- Enter areas, combat occurs, find a dead end; come back out, layout becomes shifted
- Everything is gray
- Boss fight occurs at the timeline place where the Artisan God got corrupted
