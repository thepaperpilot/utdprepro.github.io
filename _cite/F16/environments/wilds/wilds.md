- Non-corrupted normal areas
- Surrounding areas of Guardian Sanctuary
- Closer to sanctum, more field-like and plains
- Subregions

	- Daiti River Valley- green, forested region with scattered villages, most of population lives here
	- Grey and Green Crowns- northern mountain ranges of former capital next to a waterfall; villages here are more in ruins since Servant Goddess was first corrupted
	- Merchant’s Fingers- salt pans(dried up lakes); people used to harvest salt here, otherwise dangerous due to sand/water mixing to form quicksand; next to Palm Sea
	- Sinking Gardens- inland river delta of Daiti River, muddy, swampy region full of wildlife and trees; formerly had floating gardens 
	- The Golemforge- canyon/mesa region; sculptures everywhere, natural and artificial; lore carved into canyon walls, timeline of world’s history; corrupted carvings, junk piles
	- Sand Loom- shifting different colored sands, sandstorms magically shift everything into different patterns; oasis in middle
