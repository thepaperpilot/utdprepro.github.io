The player is a lady warrior who uses rope weapons to defeat enemies. The rope is made out of silk. The player will fight in arenas against humanoid enemies. They will also fight huge titans by platforming on the titans and the environment around them. Titan fights are giant set pieces. The player will attempt to disable the titan by attaching an infinite silk rope that comes out of their magic bag to key points on the titan. Eventually the Titan will be wrapped up. Once the titan is disabled the player "purifies" them restoring them to their former glory and freeing them from the control of the bad guy.
