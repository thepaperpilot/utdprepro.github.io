The general style of the game should emphasize the sense of grand adventure. They styling should be very fantasy and mystical. Realism is considerably less important to this game, especially considering the character has magic powers and fights incarnations of gods.

##### Character

I like the material design of this character. Something similar would be good. However the sheer amount of leather (and his body structure) makes the character feel weighty. Ideally I want the main character to feel airy or light. More use of silk in her design would be good. Also the colors on this character are too muted. I want the character to be vibrantly colored. Bright colors serve to highlight the character from her dusty surroundings as well as create visual appeal. Dark purples, scarlets, or bright oranges or yellows would be good. Don’t feel limited to those colors but they would be a good base. The character should also have a lot of cloth on the design that can move around. The cloth flowing around the character will accentuate the fluidity of their movement. Ideally I want the characters movements to look like a dance.

##### Enemies

I feel that enemies would generally be non-humanoid if they were gonna match the titan’s theme but don’t feel limited to that. Like the titans the enemies forms will be at least partly made out of physical materials they are possessing. They would be a mix of shadowy essence and ornately carved stone pieces or wood or mud. The god’s theme allowing. For the carved stone think midna’s helmet.

I like this image because it looks like he’s built out of building materials. Something you might build a tower out of. He’s a bit too uniform though.

I like this image because of the non uniformity of the enemy’s design.

If a titan had a nature theme this enemy design would be fitting.
