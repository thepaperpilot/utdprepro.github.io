The scope for this game is... massive to say the least. Besides the 3 major countries, there are 2 countries that might also need designing due to how they do have to do with the storyline and all the heroes will eventually visit these countries, albeit for different reasons. As such, there’s going to be a TON of world building to do, though I do have a basic idea as to what each country’s aesthetic is and how they intertwine. However, for the sake of time, the world-building would be limited to these 5 countries, maybe more IF the storyline calls for it. Plus, since all the countries’ technology is different, that’s also going to entail a lot of designing, and the animals are different from our world’s, so there’s also the matter of that. And we’re going to have to figure out the culture and style of each group of people so that’s also going to entail some concept in that area.

Overall, the break down can be this:

- Landscape

    - Each of these areas has an environment that are rather unique, so rather than dump the MASSIVE landscape on just 1 group, it may be easier if we divide the group into countries they’re interested in doing.

        - **Lorcia** The highly militarized country with mountains and valleys, they have a mixture of mountain cities and normal towns in the valley. The only really big feature about them is that they have tons of woods and many barracks. Their technology is more heavy and blocky, very militarized.

        - **Bharata** A massive empire based off of Indian culture with a mixed environment of thick forest and intensely hot areas. Their main thing is trade, so they have a lot of landing areas and ports, with most of their technology intertwined with the flow of air and water.

        - **Marvansk** An icy tundra with only bubbles of society survived by building into the mountains and underground, and is the most scientific-heavy one. They have a ton of scientific stuff based on fauna and flora that do very well in the cold, but poorly in the heat.

        - **Vanators** They’re the race that has no country, so they in colonies in the North where it’s cold, either by building into mountains or intermingling with human cities. As such, the design for their colonies will be easier since it meshes with whichever country they’re in. They typically use whichever technology is in the country they’re in.

        > - **Maybe** (unsure if the heroes will really need to visit them for the story’s sake)
        >
        >   - **Aldorf** This country is basically the same as Lorcia, and doesn’t have a hero, so the design doesn’t have to be as heavy and it can be a limited landscape to make things easier. They’re highly religious and very strict, living mostly in the mountains.
        >
        >   - **Fayer** Again, it’s like Aldorf, since it may be easier to only mention them and not have the heroes deal with them directly, we might not have to design it. But if we do, it has a very powerful rich small group with a large lower class, so it will have small bubbles of high quality areas surrounded by walls to separate from the poor, factory areas.

- Society: Figuring out what each society of each region is, and how the technology and people are from there.

    - **Lorcia** Very weaponized and militarized, their main focus in technology is how much fire power it has and how big and intimidating it is to the enemy. So maybe blockier, larger, more complicated. While most of the people seen by those passing through are in military clothing, the civilians might wear something one thinks of when they think of the Victorian era; petticoats, dresses, nice jackets and top hats, only with some steam punk elements mixed in.

    - **Bharata** Since they rely a lot of air traffic and water traffic for goods, a lot of their technology relies is very flowy, like water and air, and while simple in design is very efficient.  The inspiration for them is India, so the design for the people and culture would be very much based off of that society. So it would incorporate things like clothing, system of society, etc., into the people’s design, while also adding a steampunk element to it.

    - **Marvansk** They usually make their technology more fauna and flora based, so their technology often mimics nature and looks like it. While their technology is very complicated, it is very elegant. Because of the fact they live in freezing areas, the people are going to be wearing warmer clothing that covers them and helps them maintain heat; warm coats with fur, thick clothing, etc.

    - **Vanators** They’re a rather young race, so they don’t really have a set technology; they usually use the technology of the country they’re in and maybe scrap it together to make it work. So their tech is usually scrappy looking. Since they have a different anatomy which will be covered, their clothing is flowier and not tight to make it easier to move. They also don’t really need to wear thick clothing since they resist the cold.

- Creatures: The flora is pretty much the same as ours, so that won’t be a big focus. The creatures on the other hand can be completely crazy and out there; push the limit, feel free to make them as big and crazy or as small and unoffensive as you wish. There’s only some very small guidelines

    - **Bharata** Doesn’t really have a whole lot of terrifying fauna, but the fauna they do have is adapted to live in hot conditions

    - **Marvansk** Go crazy. The creatures here are all capable of killing you except for like maybe 1 cute tiny herbivore usually used for food. They can be big or small, however they look like they can all kill you one way or another. The really big ones are especially bad since they can wipe out entire maps if there’s as much as a glitch in the defense systems.

    - **Lorcia** Fair mixture of creatures.

- Main character design: While I might have basic concepts for them, I’m all for exploring other alternative designs

    - **Grace Vester (Lorcia)** Soldier, she’s been hardened through training and is someone who shows it. She is very intimidating and lithe, someone who you could 100% believe she could sneak up on you and end you without leaving a trace.

    - **Mavrock Krey (Marvansk)** King. He’s tall, intimidating and cunning. He looks like an oaf but knows what he’s doing, and is someone who knows how to use his size to scare others into doing what he wants.

    - **Arjun Parkash (Bharata)** He’s actually the youngest person out of the 4 heroes, and the most sensitive one. He’s young, naïve, witty and someone who wants to see the world. He’s very smart when it comes to people and is very perceptive of emotion

    - **Costine (Vanator)** She’s an experiment meant to scare and meant to kill, and she looks like it. 7 ft plus, with multiple arms that could crush steel and wings, she is stronger than any human. She is also old, as one of the original Vanators created 200 years ago. She has seen her people rise and fall time and time again, and is exhausted by all of it.
