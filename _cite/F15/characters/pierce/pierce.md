In the early years of the Vanators, the 11th and final Original Pierce had a deep thirst for conquering and destroying, as their creator had built them to do. As such, he went against the Council’s decisions and destroyed scores of cities, leaving nothing but fire, rage and hate that would last for centuries. As punishment for the destruction of thousands of innocent lives, the Council all went against him and beat him to a pulp, leaving nothing but a broken body in the deep wild mountains of Fayer to die. Centuries later, he has survived with the help of a scientist who also thirsted for power, and showed him how to build an army of mindless monsters to do such, as the Vanators’ creator had once planned. Now, he plans for a war so great the mighty world will crumble.

The last and final Original, he was the culmination of the creator’s research and prototyping; a creature of grotesque elegance who could crumble iron and bring nightmares to the enemy. Standing at 9 ft, he is a massive, broken body, his wounds never fully recovering allowing for his figure to become hideous and painful to see when one remembers how noble he once was. He is most similar to the average Vanator (wings, growth, tails, talons, etc) out of the Originals with the exception of certain mutations, and is still a terrifying figure.

Despite his appearance, Pierce has an air of nobleness to him, mostly due to how the creator showed him who to think and act the most out of all the Originals. Very intelligent, Pierce knows how to find and exploit weakness, and has no qualms of doing so, only to toss aside people once he’s done with them. Temperamental, tries to keep anger inside, so when it explodes, it really packs a punch. Remember though, he was once a very beloved person only to be turned on by the very people he loved; he feels betrayed and very hurt.
