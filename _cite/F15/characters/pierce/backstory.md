Pierce. The Hated 11th. The Originals once had an 11th member, the youngest of them all named Pierce. Pierce was the last Original created, and thus the one with least amount of mutations and imperfections, so much so that Vladimir had trained him to be his successor in a worst case scenario. After getting his wings clipped and exiled into the wilderness, he wandered in Hellion, a country desperate for scientific discovery. When he presented himself to the king as a scientist, the king gave him a chance to prove his worth. Over the years he did; genetically improved crops, cattle, animals, etc, each time gaining more and more power. Eventually he started working on humans and eventually conquered the entire country, converting most of the people into mindless monsters obedient to only him. In order to give himself time to build up forces, Pierce allowed the rest of the world to think Helyon was the same as ever, never letting them find about what he had done. Until now. And now, he wants vengeance.

Vladimir had believed that Pierce was to be his most perfect creation - the one with the least imperfections and the most power. He essentially took him on as his protege. Being so loved by his creator, and treated as better than the rest of the Vanators - even the Originals, he grew to truly believe that he was better than everybody else. Eventually, this belief would mean that he thought he was better than the man who created him - Rolf Vladimir (though he still believes in spreading Vladimir’s beliefs, he just feels like he can do that better than Vladimir himself). Pierce would help the other Vanators revolt against their creator.

He and the other Vanators after the Council had a disagreement with his ideals and plans for the Vanators - that he, with the Vanators, would rule over the world as a “heaven on earth” for Vanators.He would make humans subservient to the Vanators’ will. He wouldn’t say it outwardly, but he would rule from the shadows. However, the Vanators aren’t as war-hungry or want to make enemies with humans, nor do they want to be “rulers”. He is exiled, losing his wings and therefore, to a certain degree, his “perfection”. Despite his exile from the Vanators, he still believes them all to be “heavenly beings”, ascending above any other creature in the land, believing they should be the ones to rule. Thus, he decides to start small and infiltrates the land of Hellion. While his methods as a scientist may be shady to the Hellionians, he gets results, which is why they keep him around. However, his methods grow more and more monstrous, as he starts to experiment on humans. He cannot be stopped by that point - as he has killed the King and taken his place as the new Emperor.

- Still believes in Vladimir’s philosophy and is trying to spread it on a worldwide scale

- Which is why he’s trying to take over the nations and why he creates his own monsters - just as Vladimir created the Vanators

- He’s trying to reunite the Vanators because he feels that they are all heavenly creatures and they should stay together. Thus he’s getting the Hellion forces to hate Vanators to encourage them to come to his side

Personality: Pierce seems to be a calculating creature with devious intentions. He lacks moral ethics and is willing to kill anyone in his way or if they will help him achieve his goals.

Questions: How does his story unfold through the game?
