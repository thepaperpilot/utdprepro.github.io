Possible Party Member for Grace. The King of Lorcia, he is a young king; he only became King a little before Grace graduated from the military Academy, so he’s rather young. Yet he is aware of how young he is, and is the sort of person to surround himself with people he knows can cover him in areas that he doesn’t know much about. He is rather wise for his age, and knows what he’s doing, but he is constantly having to worry about his country not being crushed by the surrounding empires.

Tall (5 ft 10- 6ft), commands respect. He’s a nobleman and he looks like it, he is a commanding figure of respect and power. Even though he’s young, he has a very wise feeling to him, and he gives off the vibe of knowing what he’s doing. He’s a king, so he wears very high quality items and very rarely gets his hands dirty. He looks like the person to delegate his power and is very rarely messy.

He is a delegator; he’s aware that he’s not very experienced so he often delegates his power to people he knows can handle this. He isn’t really comfortable with the idea of being king; he was supposed to not become king, but when his older sibling died he had no choice but to be thrusted into the position with not much training. He is a trial by error sort of person and once he knows something is bad he will not do it again. He understands the burden of responsibility and often is well loved by his younger delegates as he relates rather well to them.
