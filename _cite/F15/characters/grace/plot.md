###### Primary Conflict

The King of Lorcia, King Leonius Warpolt is concerned with the state of affairs between Marvansk and Hellion. Additionally, Aldorf is reporting more attacks from Vanators. He knows war is coming, and they must prepare.

###### Rising Action

King Warpolt sends Grace and the Black Brigade (BB) to Bharata to escort Jarvis Jacobs, Minister of Foreign Affairs. Jacobs gets kidnapped before BB can escort. Grace can:

- Track down Jacobs by stopping the rebellion and beat up the people that caused it (leads to Good ending)

    - Kill a few, convince leader to stand down (Good)

    - Get captured, convince leader to stand down (Peace)

    - Sneak into hideout, kill all the rebels (Bad)

- Escort caravans

    - No matter what - always (Good)

    - Sometimes will get ambushed

    - Compensated based on success

- Track down criminals/crime bosses

    - Kill some, capture main criminals (Good)

    - Beat up some thugs, recruit into BB (Peace)

    - Kill the bastards (Bad)

Major Mission: Davis Mikaelson - a nobleman and friend of Jacobs - hires Grace and BB to rescue his wife, Lady Shreya, from sky pirates (Mikaelson is actually the perpetrator so Shreya would die or be assumed dead and he would get her fortune)

- Sneak into airship base, rescue Shreya, capture Davis Mikaelson and expose his corrupt ass down to the law (Good)

- Sneak in, rescue Shreya, beat up Mikaelson, take his money, and turn him into the authorities (Peace)

- Sneak OR bust in, kill all sky pirates AND Mikaelson, traumatizing Shreya (Bad)

Grace returns to Lorcia with new missions:

- Kill soldiers/monsters in the wildlands

- Save kidnapped people from Hellion

- Courier Missions

Soldiers and monsters from Hellion have been attacking in the north. Grace and BB must intercept and remove them:

- Fight them until they’re forced to surrender (Good)

- Try diplomacy first and then fight them (Peace)

- Kill them all, no questions asked (Bad)

Slaying the Slayers: Monsters from Hellion have been attacking places, and Slayers have come to assist in the fight against them. However, the one colony in Lorcia is not happy with the Slayers’ presence. Grace can:

- Use the Slayers to kill the monsters but keep the Slayers away from the Vanators (Good)

- Use both Vanators and Slayers to fight the monsters  and then try to get some diplomacy between them (Peace)

- Use slayers to kill monsters, abandon Vanators by giving Slayers free reign in Lorcia (Bad)

A so-called Vladimirian points out the the colony in Lorcia is leaving the country for no apparent reason. Curious, Grace tracks them and comes across Arjun. She learns that the Vladimirians are planning to slaughter all of the Vanators. Grace and the BB can:

- Help the Brigade fight off the Vladimirians while they load the ship (Good)

- Have BB help with loading the ship while other military forces deal with Vladimirians (losing some Brigadiers in the process) (Peace)

- Kill all of the Vladimirians and not care if someone is left behind (Bad)

###### Climax

Grace heads north via airship and arrive in Marvansk after some smaller missions dealing with the monsters. Grace meets Costine as Arjun brings her back from Bharata. She reveals that their common enemy is Pierce (main villain) - an exiled Vanator who has taken control of Hellion for nefarious purposes. Now, missions are:

- Securing rally points

- Missions to raise morale, improve BB and other military squadrons

- Convince Leonius to send more troops

- Convince Minister of Finance to give more $$$

- Prepare for battle by learning new weapons technologies and incorporating it into battle

Major Mission: Ball

Grace goes to Marvansk’s capital to ask Mavrock for an alliance to fight against Hellion, being that Marvansk is a superpower. Grace can:

- Do cooperative missions

- Escort him around

- Fight off assassins to help earn his gratitude and loyalty

- This Mission helps in the Ball since Marvansk is a superpower and has agreed to help, other leaders are more likely to agree to join

Ball (Political event for ambassadors to try to get things done): Held with all major countries present, Grace must convince all the leaders to help go to war against Pierce and join the cause

FINAL BATTLE:

- As Grace is the most military-oriented character, she strategizes the military troops and maintaining the rally points to ensure victory in the battle versus Hellion

- Battle versus Hellion forces is won, Pierce defeated

###### Falling Action

After the defeat of Pierce, Grace can:

- Improve national relations by talking with the leaders of Lorcia/Marvansk

- Strengthen military further and raise morale

###### Conclusion

Good Ending: Morale is high, Brigade is maxed out, Vanators are supported, Marvansk and Lorcia are allies, and Grace gets a Medal of Valor from King Leonius and is revered and respected as a military hero, given a title from Bharata

Peace Ending: Morale is medium or high, Vanators are in a neutral relationship, Marvansk and Lorcia are neutral, and Grace gets a medal of honor and is revered and respected as a military hero, gains the position of military coordinator of the United Powers’ armies

Bad Ending: Moral is low or medium, the Brigade has lost a ton of troops and hate Grace, the other countries fear or hate her, Vanators are hunted, Marvansk and Lorcia are enemies, she receives the Medal of Valor and the Bharatans consider her to be a mercenary rather than a military leader. Grace is a ruthless commander.
