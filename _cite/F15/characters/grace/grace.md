The black brigade is Lorcia’s greatest military force, answering only to the king rather than to the council of generals, and it makes sense that one of its 3 founders, Vester, is as equally intense as the Brigade itself. Coming from a long line of generals, she broke away from the family after her mother and she had a falling out, causing her to focus even harder on doing better than her mother. In the beginning, she, James and Henrick founded the Brigade while they were in military academy, and upon its official creation under the king, Grace has become its commander, with James as her 2nd in command and Henrick as the hand to the king (long story). While her strongest point is strategizing, she also has to interact with multiple ministers to deal with war plans and budget issues.

Roughly 5 ft 7-8, Vester is the 2nd smallest hero that is playable, and is capable of disguising herself in either gender depending on what the mission calls for. Combining her childhood and her academy training, she is the most efficient human hero at combat, though she specializes more in long range and silent take downs than direct combat. Weapons of choice are a sword and a sniper rifle.

Intelligent, honestly blunt, somewhat arrogant and relatively tempered, Vester tends to be straight and to the point, occasionally being rather mean and having a very odd sense of humor (battle humor, morbid humor, etc). She’s extremely close to her brigade, and is very caring about their well-being, and has a personal disgust with nobility. Loyal to the core to the king, the country’s well-being is her top priority. Her uniform is a black uniform with goggles for snipering.

**Pros:**

- For players who like strategizing and fighting, this character is the one to play as. Her game play involves having to upgrade and get new battle formations for her brigade based on how many missions they succeed, so the player can play it similarly to fire emblem to a degree.

- Long range combat dominant with some strengths in close combat

- Works in both outdoor and indoor combat

- Has the least amount of interaction with politics

- Has a brigade that helps in many missions

- Explores a lot for the missions.

- **Abilities:**

    - Battle Call: Can summon her brigade or allies automatically to any enemy of choice.

    - Disguise: Depending on the situation, Vester can disguise herself and be unseen by the enemy for a while.

**Cons:**

- For players who like to charge into battle, this is not a character for you.

- Her disguise only works so long as the player doesn’t bring attention to themselves. If Vester causes a scene (argument, swipes something in front of someone, etc), she will get caught.

- Is pretty bad at dealing with non-military technology.

- Has a lot to do with moral. If one doesn’t like doing side quests for moral, this is not for you.

- Exploration is limited by missions.
