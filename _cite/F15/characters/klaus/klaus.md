Possible Party Companion for Costine. A Clanless Vanator, Klaus is a fallen warrior who has had to go through life alone, afraid and constantly fighting. Reckless in battle, headstrong and loyal to only himself, he’s a bit of an oddity by Vanator standards as he has severed WILLINGLY all his ties to his Clan after his Clan Leader traded him into slavery in exchange for the Clan not being killed by Slayers.

7 ft even, Klaus is big by non-Original Vanatorian standards, being a colossal angry force in battle. Due to his life on the road and on the run, most of his tunic-like attire is worn out, with holes or entire parts missing and him not giving a single hoot about it. Having fought many, he has his fair share of scars, his most notable one being the fact he’s missing his wings after having them hacked off when he was a child, a fact he’s still very bitter about. Another oddity is that he’s actually pretty okay with technology, most likely to make up for the fact he doesn’t have wings.

Angry, reckless in battle and extremely sarcastic. He’s found that sarcasm is a great way to deal with humans and getting them to leave him alone without actually having to waste energy punching them into a grave. Fact of the matter is though, is that he’s just tired. After a lifetime of traveling, all he wants is a place to call home without having to worry about humans trying to catch him and make him into a slave or a pincushion. Thanks to being on the run for so long, Klaus is very good at surviving. Knowing what foods to eat, hunting, building shelter, hiding from Slayers- the guy knows his way in the woods.
