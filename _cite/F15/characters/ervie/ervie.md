The woman who was the nanny to Mavrock and didn’t go insane in the attempt. A very kindhearted woman, she raised Mavrock and has been a mother to him in every sense of the word. It’s thanks to her that he’s not entirely devoid of emotion or passion; she’s the sort of person who can find a humanizing emotion in even the most devious of people. Currently is the nanny to Mavrock’s younger sister Lilia.

5ft 6-7 ish, looks to be in late 50’s to early 70’s. Even though she is hella old, she still appears to be radiating beam of energy that is impossible to keep down. In her age she’s put on a bit of weight, looking more and more like a tiny chubby grandma of joy and happiness more than like a nanny. Because she is a nanny for royalty, she does have clothing of relative high quality, as well as a couple of simple jewelry pieces. However, all of her clothing is very thick as she does live in a tundra.

Ervie has felt loss - The loss of her husband, the loss of her children, the loss of her brother- the list goes on. However, she’s always powered through this with a smile not for her sake, but for her ward’s sake. She is very good at always appearing happy because she’s 100% sure that while troubles are a pain, sometimes all someone needs is a bit of kindness and joy to make it through the day. Despite this, she’s a very human person, often trying to get her wards to show their emotions more towards her because of how stressful the job is. She is a shoulder to lean on, and has thus earned her rightful place in the Royal family as that one person both royal siblings would murder for.
