A possible party member for Arjun. Hailing from a small Clan in Aldorf, his entire life he has spent defending his Clan from outside attacks and attempting to ensure its survival. With his Clan gone, the young Vanator is completely out of his element and searches for his Clan’s allies in the North.

Rather young, so he caps out at around 6 ft something. Since he’s a fullblood and not an original, rather than have mutations he has the standard Vanator body features; thick leathery skin, some horns/growths, wings, and talons sharp enough to cut through metal. He is a warrior, and as such, has spent most of his life training; he’s practically a brick wall. Clothing is more like a tunic than anything. Due to the weird anatomy Vanators have, tight clothing really isn’t an option for them, so they tend to wear tunics or some other forms of loose-clothing.

Ridiculously loyal to Vanators and to people who he deems worthy. Is often the first one to rush to defend someone regardless of danger, often not realizing that the other person is just fine and doesn’t require help. Doesn’t quite realize how terrifying he can be at times. Remember, he is very young by Vanator standards, so there’s several things he can be rather naive about. Since his interactions with humans has been limited, he doesn’t realize just how much stronger he is than some, often accidentally scaring people without meaning to.
