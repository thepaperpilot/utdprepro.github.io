A party member of Costine. An ex-nun under Sister Theresa, Laura was “forced to retire” after having endangered Vanator younglings of a nearby Clan and nearly having the nunnery attacked. She’s very young, and has been molded by some of the people she knows to dislike Vanators, for good reason.

A woman of average height (5 ft 4-10), Laura doesn’t seem all that intimidating due to how tiny she appears to be. She doesn’t exactly strike many as a person to be afraid of. It’s very clear that she’s never really had to survive before outside the nunnery; there’s not a scar on her and she really looks out of place in a wilderness or battle setting. While she’s no longer a nun, she still dresses very conservatively and warmly as Aldorf is still a freezing place, with a satchel to hold several materials (books, maps, plants, etc).

Very young, she mostly acts the way she acts to attempt to please people, like some of the other sisters or the people that she looks up to. As such, she may be stubborn in changing her opinion, but if shown proper evidence might be able to change her opinion. An ex-nun, she holds many of the morals from the religion; humbleness, kindness, generosity (often not a good thing as she might give something to someone she really shouldn’t) etc, and often acts as if she’s always on the higher moral horse, so to speak.
