Giver of missions to Grace. The hand to the king and advisor on war plans, Henrick is an old friend of Grace’s as they created the Black Brigade together along with Grace’s 2nd in command James. After becoming Advisor to King, he has settled down with a family and has not really seen combat in a while. He is doing his best to ensure that Lorcia has no fears of invasion and that the army branches are all working in unity rather than against each other.

5 ft 6-8, it shows he was once heavily involved in conflict. He has let himself go a bit over the years but is still more than capable of sticking a bullet between someone’s eyes from any distance if given the right gun. Has some facial hair and isn’t exactly showing wrinkles yet, though he’s starting to get to around that age. Often wears a military uniform - either his old Black Brigade one or his new one as grand military Advisor.

Raised on the streets, becoming a military cadet, creating the Black Brigade, somehow becoming Military Advisor to the King- if there’s one thing he’s learned, it’s to adapt to just about everything thrusted his way. A very open person after years in the Brigade and the nobility system, Henrick knows how to befriend people and how to be wary of them all at once. While he dislikes putting soldiers in danger, he’s aware of how necessary it can be at times.
