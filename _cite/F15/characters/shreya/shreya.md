Possible Party Member for Grace. A high standing noble from Bharata, Shreya was raised to carry on the family name and is used to being treated as if her opinion didn’t matter as her family usually decided things for her. Now that she has left that life behind and is in Lorcia with Grace, she’s quickly learning that the world is a harsh place but that working through it is what makes life an adventure.

Height is up for debate, definitely not hardened by battle or hardship, she’s a very elegant and beautiful person who is aware of her beauty. Very youthful looking, she’s very graceful after having learned how to move and be a proper noble even in the most heaviest of attires. Bharata is a very warm country, so most of her clothing, while conservative, is still very lightweight and thinner than the thick clothing necessary for the weather of the North. Does have knives hidden away in the sashes.

A noblewoman of a high standing family, she’s never really had the chance to see the world, even if she thinks she knows about it because of her tutors. She’s not very used to people of middle class or lower class, much less them actually talking back to her, so she’s still learning how to balance her upbringing with being an actual nice human being. She knows how to manipulate and read other nobles like even an open book, so she can easily get what she wants from people she despises without them ever knowing it.
