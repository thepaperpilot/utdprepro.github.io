The 2nd original ever created, Costine is almost 200 years old, having seen her people rise and fall throughout the ages. Her race is that of the Vanators, winged beings created by Rolf Vladimir to be monsters used in battle, capable of shattering steel with their bare hands and surviving in the coldest of temperatures. Draconian in design, the Vanators all have leathery-scaley skin, thicker than the average human’s, and their legs are something akin to legs you’d find on a large lizard, talons and all. Massive creatures, Vanators are built like bricks and are capable of taking heavy damage and tearing through ships if necessary. Because she is an Original, she and the other Originals have more mutations than the others of their race, ranging from color, number of eyes, number of limbs and wing, abilities, etc. Vanators also have growths on them that can act as plating and armor, which can be filed down into a form that best suits that Vanator, as well as horns that vary from each individual. All Vanators have 2 abilities, a passive and an aggressive.

Costine herself stands at 8 ft 4, with a wingspan of 29+ feet from tip to tip and weighs in at 400 lbs. While she is by no means the largest Vanator, she’s larger than non-Original Vanators which is useful for intimidating opponents. Like the originals, she does have some mutations, including 6  eyes, longer ears, and 4 muscled arms, with the bottom two having extra thick plating that can be used to block several melee attacks (within reason). Like all Vanators, she’s primarily carnivorous, with teeth that match such a diet. Because of her anatomy, tight clothing is very useless so she wears more tunic-like clothing that allow for higher movement with less restraints.

As the 2nd oldest known Vanator, Costine is a wise individual who knows for a fact that while some humans can be trusted, her people are still viewed by many as monsters rather than as individuals. A cautious person, she’s very picky about who she trusts, and it takes a lot for her to fully trust someone given the treatment of her people. As a Neutral Vanator (she has no bloodline), she’s often called in by Clans of Vanators to act as a judge to settle disputes and act as a diplomat, which over time has given her a strong sense of moral and justice. Despite her age, and her interactions, Costine is to a degree a bit naïve about certain things. She and the vast majority of Vanators didn’t exactly get to have an education, so her ability to read and write is mostly self-taught and there’s things about this world she’s never seen before, so she actually has the curiosity of an excitable child when she sees something new and interesting.

**Pros:**

- The strongest character you can play in the game, as she can basically beat things to a pulp with her fists and is the most combat based character (if a player is more into battle this is the character to play).

- Abilities:

    - Passive: Allows for her to predict an attack from up to 10 seconds randomly.

    - Aggressive: For a limited amount of time, she can phase through a physical thing, be it a person of a thing. But doing so means she needs to be at full energy

- Gets to do the most amount of exploring as she is the one traveling on foot the most

**Cons:**

- Has waaaay more enemies than the other heroes to deal with

- Can only travel in cold areas. Vanators have a higher body temperature so traveling in hot places like the south of Bharata is not an option

- Has the hardest time making political allies

- Given her sheer size and anatomy, indoor combat is near impossible for her, which makes it harder for her to fight indoors.

- Is extremely bad at dealing with technology.
