- I am Costine, a Vanator.

- I am the 2nd Original.

- For my people!

- With age comes wisdom.

- Protect the Vanators!

- You are nothing to me.

- I am not a monster!

- We are not monsters!

- We are living, breathing beings just like you! We feel just as much as you. Just as much human.

- We strive to live in this world. To find a place for ourselves. That is all.

- Please!

- I have fought for so long to get us where we are now. I won’t let you ruin it.

- You will not take me down!

- I have been a part of this vast world for so long, but I’ve yet to see everything.

- Commander Vester, you fight with grace,

- Don’t be so arrogant, King.
