**Catchphrase:** Wondrous!

- I am Mavrock Krey, the King of Marvansk.

- Stand down.

- You will stand down.

- Bow.

- Bow before me.

- For Marvansk!

- Marvelous!

- Simply wondrous!

- Never!

- I am King!

- Nonsense!

- Haha! Wondrous!

- How delightful!

- Haha!

- You cannot defeat me!

- I am Marvansk!
