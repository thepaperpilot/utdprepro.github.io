King of the frozen country Marvansk. As the most politically powerful character in the entire game, he knows how to manipulate and how to do it well. Raised to be a king, he knows how to carry himself and has an air of arrogance to him. Everything he owns is of the highest quality, and he is used to getting what he wants and having it to the maximum quality. Due to his country’s need for science to survive, he himself has some mastery in science, especially in the areas of electro-magnetism, so that’s another area of arrogance he has. Typically he wears the colors of his country, white and blue, and is the sort who prefers to look sharp at all times. Given his position and his abilities as a scientist, the rare few times he is in battle, he shows off as much as possible.

Roughly 6 ft +, Mavrock is the second largest hero out of the 4 playable options, and relies on an electric spear of his creation for the very few times he actually shows up in battle, as well as his armoured war bear. Most of the time, he hangs back and lets his soldiers take care of it.

Cunning, manipulative and very good at finding people’s weaknesses, Mavrock is an expert at fighting with words and taking down his opponents in that manner. While he can be rather cold hearted towards others, he is surprisingly caring about his younger siblings and certain people close to him all his life, and finds them to be his weakness as half his motivation for doing the things he does is keeping them safe, though he’d never admit it. He has a lot to live up to, with his parents having set some pretty high expectations after their passing, and while some respect him, the public as of yet to form an opinion of him since he’s never really interacted with the lesser classes and severely lacks knowledge on how normal people are.

**Pros:**

- For players looking for more of a mental challenge and strategizing in stuff besides battle, Mavrock is better fit for their style of play.

- Fairly balanced when it comes to battle stats so long as he’s on his warbear.

- Once he starts having people under sway, he can do more things. For example, once he has the financial minister on his side he can have a bigger budget to do whatever he pleases

- Unlike the other characters, Mavrock doesn’t need to go to a scientist upgrade his tech as he is a scientist to a degree, making it easier to upgrade his tech.

- Player gets to play around with tech more and create certain weapons and tools of their choice so long as they have the materials

- Player gets to ride on a badass warbear and can go on occasional hunts to upgrade his battle capabilities.

- Abilities:

    - Sway: Once Mavrock knows the weakness of a character, he can use Sway to get that character under his control and have them do what he wants.

    - Thunder strike: This is more of a battle ability for the times he is in battle. Thunder strike causes Mavrock to use his spear to create a massive barrage of electricity, causing widespread damage over a much larger stage.

**Cons:**

- The second Mavrock is separated from his warbear, he is much more vulnerable to attack as his spear is better used for medium to long range attack.

- He sucks at close hand-to-hand combat indoors as spears are not that maneuverable of a weapon indoors.

- Even though he can upgrade his teach a lot quicker than the other heroes, he can only do so if the budget allows for him to do so.

- He has the least amount of combat opportunities

- He can’t explore the worlds and other countries as expansively as the other heroes since he is king and he has a high chance of being captured.
