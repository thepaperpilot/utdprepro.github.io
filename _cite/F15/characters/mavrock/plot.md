###### Tutorial

Unpopular Poles: Get rid of councilman, persuade people to do things for you, and go fight stuff

- Go over conversation mechanics/options

- Get out of castle, go to the training grounds, go over combat commands

- (A suspicious sound) Go towards it (Hunting tutorial), find it, kill it

###### Primary Conflict

While holding a meeting with all his ministers, a scream is heard throughout the castle - the scream of Mavrock’s younger sister, Katerina. Upon coming across her, they see a mutated Vanator wearing the armor of Hellion, about to strike down his sister. Killing him, Mavrock swears to destroy Hellion and find out who is responsible for this.

###### Rising Action

During this time, Mavrock would be keeping the peace in his country while dealing with people coming to his country. During this time he has allies; the woman who raised him and watches over his younger sibling Ervie, and her nephew Thomas (romanceable ally) who grew up together with Mavrock, a rather good observer of the court and entertainer for the court.

- Corruption in the Government

    - Track some corrupt officials down and use the information as blackmail to have sway over them (Good ending)

    - Track them down have them publicly apologize and kick them out to replace them with someone else (Peace ending)

    - Track them down and have them executed (Bad ending)

- Impression Hunt: To impress a diplomat from another country, Mavrock must go on a hunt with them and hunt the biggest monster possible to show his strength.

- Abduction or Abdication: Mavrock is knocked out (wine poison) at a meeting with the counsel by unknown enemies of Marvansk (Hellion forces). His captors at this point can’t decide on either killing him or keeping him in exile. They kidnap him, Mavrock escapes (battles in between escape), discovers that there are people or a hidden enemy that is trying to take him and his country down. Mavrock does not know who the enemy is.

    - (Pierce’s perspective): Intends to dispose Mavrock and replace him with a noble that would be much more malleable to his (Hellion’s) will. Intends to make the nation have a policy against Vanators to push them into a corner where the only country that can support them is Hellion, thus having control over the Vanator race

    - Corrupt Minister wants to take down Mavrock and take over control of Marvansk. The Minister makes a deal with Pierce (Money from Marvansk/Protection from Helyon) in order to make this possible, and cooperates with Pierce under the shadow.

- Liar, Liar: A Vanator and a human are two major suspects in a crime that has scared the kingdom to its core; having unleashed a beast being held for research upon a defenceless town and colony of Vanators. One is lying and the other is not, and the case has gotten so out of hand that it has been brought to the king. He can:

    - Side with the Vanators (gain Vanatorian strengthened bond, but lose some loyalty from human citizens)

    - Side with the humans (Gain more loyalty but lose some level of trust from the Vanators)

    - Pardon both (loses and gains nothing)

    - Kill both (loses trust and loyalty from both sides)

- Clan battle: A clan of Vanators has sent Razeth, a female diplomat (romanceable ally) to help smooth things over between Vanators and humans, especially after some rouge Vanator attacked the royal family. However, because she is some a powerful Clan, some of the other colonies fear that she will abuse this influence to bring the demise of other Clans, causing tensions to run extremely high. Mavrock can:

    - Talk to all the Clan leaders and convince them that they have nothing to fear (good ending)

    - Talk to the Clan Leaders and give each of their Clans some new level of influence as a sign of trust (Peace ending)

    - Send soldiers out to deal with them and force them to kneel (Bad ending)

- Conquests: Gain some new land in multiple missions against Helyon

- Negotiations: A diplomat sent by Lorcia escorted by Grace Vester (romanceable ally) has come, asking for Mavrock to not invade Lorcian or Aldorfan lands. Before a decision can be struck though, a group of Helyons and monsters too hideous to be Vanators come into the castle to kill the royal family, and they must work together to kick out the forces.

- Hunt down the Helyon Forces: Mavrock and Grace find and eliminate the attackers, discover that the Helyon country is the cause of the instability in Marvansk and in many other nations.

Leading up to the climax:

Mavrock and Grace discover similarities between the hideous monsters and some mutated vanator corpses lying around. Throughout examination, they come to realize that no human in the world (as they know) has any access to these kinds of genetic medications. They conclude that a vanator might’ve been capable of manipulating their genes to the point they could transfer it somehow (genetic anthropomorphism, new - birth (stem) genes being passed on, highly unorthodox experiments in general). They suspect, judging from the large, oddly - shaped footprints, that the vanator responsible for this must be nearby, so they go searching for it. Upon their search Costine appears.

###### Climax

To the surprise of everyone, the 2nd Original Costine (Romanceable ally) has been improving relations between Vanators and humans in Marvansk, ending up in the court of the King. She brings heavy news of who their opponent is; Pierce, an exiled Vanator, who has taken over the minds of the Helyon country and used their technology to create an army of monsters. As such, they must ready for war.

- Refugees: A Bharatan merchant named Arjun (romanceable ally) comes with a group of displaced Clans, all of which are being hunted by Vladimirians. Mavrock can:

    - Fight a few Vladimirians and talk to the leader to get them out of his country (good ending)

    - Be diplomatic from the start, and getting them to leave his country with minimal casualties. (Peace ending)

    - Killing all of them (bad ending)

- In the chaos of the refugees, Costine is captured and Arjun goes to rescue her along with her allies. In the meantine, Mavrock must keep the Clans at peace and avoid the relations from getting worse.

###### Falling Action

Multiple missions to increase or worsen relations with other heroes and countries.

###### Conclusion

Good ending: All his political opponents are knowingly or unknowingly under his sway, 1 or less heroes are dead, his country stands proud. They have gained the land of Helyon.

Peace ending: None of the heroes are dead, some of the political rivals are under his sway, and the Vanators are active protectors of his land and are now his neighbors on the map.

Bad ending: More of the heroes are dead, the country is successful but so much blood has been shed that all the other countries are making plans to fight back in case. The Vanators are tense and are moving deeper into the wild away from humans.
