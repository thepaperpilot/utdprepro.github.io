The youngest playable character, Arjun is the son of a very wealthy merchant who has finally been given the opportunity to travel the world and trade for the first time in the aircraft, the Golden Wing. Bharata is based off of India, so he himself wears clothing that is similar to that culture while also employing several steampunk elements. His clothing are the most colourful and it shows that he’s a very bright, young person ready to see the world for the first time. As a Bharatan citizen, he’s never really had the chance to see how politics outside of his country work, as his country has been at peace for decades more or less and is considered to be a very stable area, so he’s going to be thrown in there and have to figure out how or what to do in this new environment.

Roughly  5ft 5-7, he is probably the smallest out of all the heroes as he really hasn’t undergone much physical training in combat and mostly relies on shotguns, small knives and his crewmates to work together to take down combatants. His crew consists of multiple people and of small cargo robots, both of which can accompany the hero and help in combat or manipulating scenarios.

A very witty character, what he lacks in experience he makes up for the fact he is very much a people person and knows how to get people to work together. A very likable person, he’s very amiable and open to new ideas, constantly on the look-out to see what else he can explore and use in his business. His downfall is that he’s rather reckless and a tad too trusting at times, often giving people second and third chances even when there’s ample reason to not to. Arjun has multiple conflicting interests, since on one hand he wants to help the areas he lands in, and on the other, his actions can cause his father’s trade business to get a bad man depending on what he does, so he’s always struggling to find a balance between these two.

Most of his gameplay is character interactive based, and he requires that interaction to get further down the game.

Can travel a lot, as he is in an aircraft, and gets to have sky battles with pirates, monsters and other characters.

Since he is good with people, he can get allies a lot better than the other heroes.

Has a fair mixture of combat, manipulation and strategy, for the players that want a bit of everything.

Is best at combat in closed spaces as a shotgun has limited range and he can use his size to avoid attack.

**Pros:**

- Is the wittiest and funniest out of all 4 characters; he’s the character that players find the most humorous and arguably the most human.

- Abilities:

    - Robot back up: Can summon his cargo robots to assist in any task necessary (picking heavy things up and moving them, fighting, etc)

    - Sensitivity: When having conversations, he can tell when someone is lying and when someone isn’t, allowing him to piece certain things together. This makes it easier for him to know who to ally himself with

**Cons:**

- Is the weakest character in terms of combat and battle.  Mostly relies on team, so if the player is used to doing solo missions this really isn’t the character for him.

- While it’s easy for him to make allies, it is also hard to keep his credibility up based on who he allies with. Certain characters will make him lose credibility in certain countries, so he has to be very careful with that

- Limited cargo space – He can only help so many groups of people at once. Depending on who he helps it changes the story, so he has to be careful with who he picks.

- In outdoor combat he is easy pickings.
