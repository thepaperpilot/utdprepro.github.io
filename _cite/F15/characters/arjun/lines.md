**Catchphrase:** Sounds like a deal!

- Hello, I am Arjun Parkash, a simple merchant-in-training.

- What an adventure!

- I am seeing delightful new things, meeting wonderful new people, and learning more and more with each passing moment. I am learning right now. What more could I ask for?

- I love meeting new people!

- Well, that didn't work out as well as I thought...

- I can help!

- I may be a simple merchant, but I can help you!

- I'm not so useless that I cannot fight.

- I refuse!

- I can relate.

- No!

- Yes!

- Gripping!

- Interesting!

- Please forgive me, I forgot to introduce myself!

- A handshake is equivalent to a promise when it comes to trading.

- 50 for just one (currency)? What a steal!

- I can tell that this is a loss just by seeing it.

- No deal!
