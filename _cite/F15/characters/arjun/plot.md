### Alin Path

Arjun sides with Vanators, saving a lone Vanator named Alin

Alin explains the situation regarding relations between the local Vanator Clans and the people of Aldorf. Clans are in desperate situation.

Alin either chooses to willingly assist the Vanators or is forced to by his crew.

As Arjun goes through these towns he must assist the Vanators either willingly or forcibly.

    - Intimidate merchant guild leader to stop him from manipulating the city’s laws

    - Talk to both set of merchants and try to find a middle ground (Peaceful End)

    - Kill merchant guild leader (Bad End)

    - Find traitor and stop him non lethally (Good End)

    - Convince another noble to make traitor a captain of his own (Peaceful End)

    - Kill traitor (Bad End, loses credibility)

> MORE MISSIONS TO COME

Arjun and Alin make it to Lorcia where the clan resides and is currently having trouble with the nation's Black Brigade. Commander Grace Vester (romanceable) is convinced to stand down either by

- A duel where the objective is to convince her that negotiations are possible (Good/Peaceful End)

- Killing many of the Black Brigaders until she’s forced to come to the table (Bad End)

Vladimirians are closing in, Lorcia stretched too far to help, therefore the King lends Grace to Arjun to relocate the clan to the north and away from the instability

- Stolen Cargo: Golden Wing captured by sky-pirates, force crew to chains as they pillage the ship.

    - Destroy one of the pirate ships to force them to retreat (Good End)

    - Get to the captain who is revealed to be one of the sky pirates from the tutorial- if his friends weren’t murdered, he’ll willingly leave (Peaceful End)

    - Kill Everyone (Bad End)

#### Climax

- Liars: Helyon spy in the king’s circle trying to convince Mavrock to exile the Vanators, must be defeated

#### Falling Action

Arjun can either improve or worsen relations with other heroes, such as helping them destroy villains or help them achieve their goals

- Assist them in political take overs

- killing other heroes

- improving credibility

- ect.

#### Conclusion

Good: Arjun kept his company’s name strong, only killed with the best intentions. Seen as a hero to the Vanators, expanded his merchant reach to several nations, given free passage to Marvansk and Lorcia and a nobility title by Mavrock

Peaceful: Arjun kept the other heroes alive at the cost of expanding his company- despite this, he is rewarded with the title of Honorary Vanator and made a member of Alin’s clan

Bad: Often solved his problems with murder, established his company as an effective, but cutthroat merchant group, is feared across nations and even by the Vanators. Vester will wait for the day he crosses the line so she can kill him.
