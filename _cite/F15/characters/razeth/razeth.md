Possible Party Companion for Mavrock. Razeth is the daughter of a Clan Leader in Marvansk, having been raised to understand the importance of human-Vanator alliances as she herself is the result of a human and a Vanator. Due to the recent rise in dislike for Vanators as well as tensions, she has been sent by the Clans to talk to Mavrock and attempt to solidify a workable alliance with him.

Because of her human blood, Razeth is rather normal in height (5ft 6) rather than the typical 5 ft 10- 6 ft 7 height Vanators have, and is rather lithe in comparison to the average Vanator. She also isn’t as brightly colored and has much smaller growths/horns/talons/tail, lacking also a thick skin (physically). She has been trained to fight and it shows. Because she is a Clan Leader’s heir, and her Clan has good relations with humans to have resources, Razeth wears a high quality tunic with bracelets, a more complex design than most Vanators to show her status.

Razeth is the daughter of a Clan Leader and will someday have to inherit that title, meaning she’ll have to keep good relations between humans and Vanators while doing what’s best for her people. She has a ton of expectations to live up to, and rushes to fill them to the best of her ability, often overworking herself to the point of becoming ill to ensure everything is running as smoothly as possible. A bookworm, all the knowledge on humans she has is from either books or from the few Honorary Vanators, so whenever she has access to books she reads them quite in depth. She does have some misinformed stereotypes about humans given her books, but the chance to interact with humans is always exciting and interesting for her.
