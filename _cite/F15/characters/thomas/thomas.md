Possible Party companion for Mavrock. The nephew of Ervie, he came to know Mavrock when the two of them hadn’t even hit double digits yet, becoming Mavrock’s servant and advisor of sorts as the two grew up. While they are well past their days of boyhood, Thomas is still Mavrock’s most trusted ally and can be counted on to keep Mavrock from going crazy with responsibilities, whether it be going with him to hunt or helping him hide the body of a political enemy.

5 ft 10-11 ish, mid 30’s. He hasn’t had much combat experience and is rather lithe, looking more like a butler than like an advisor. While he is rather youthful, he has some few silver hairs and some facial hair. He may be an adult, but there’s still a twinkle in his eye that shows he has a knack for pranks and mischief, whatever he has up his sleeve in that moment. Typically he dresses in what you’d expect a butler to wear; clean cut clothing with a simple design.

Mischievous, very odd and surprisingly human. One must understand, he wasn’t born into royalty or nobility, he was thrust into it when his parents died and his custody went to Ervie. As such, he often is at odds with nobles and lacks patience for them, something he covers up using pranks. He also is one of the few people who knows how to talk to Mavrock without getting manipulated and can comfort him openly with no fears. Bold, witty, is 10000% the type of person who would break up an awkward silence with a shitty pun (not even a witty one)
