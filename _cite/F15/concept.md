The game allows for the player to follow 1 of 4 storylines, each of them large and branching which allows for multiple endings and full immersive gameplay. Each character and their abilities differ, so the gameplay for certain scenarios is differing. For example, as a king you don’t so much combat as you do manipulate, so most of the scenarios will involve getting people to bow to your will with the occasional hack and slash gameplay. Meanwhile, for the commander, you get the more traditional shooting/sniper gameplay, while also able to control your squad and strategize with them. Each country also is very unique in culture and technology allowing for full exploration of each option, and giving each hero a different experience of the game. What’s unique is that your experience will be different depending on the hero, and will be very choice-heavy.
