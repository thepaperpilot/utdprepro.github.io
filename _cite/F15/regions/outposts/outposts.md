Vanators don’t have official countries, living in colonies around human society or deep in the wilderness where humans don’t dare go near. A rather young race, what they lack of worldly knowledge or politics they more than make up for in sheer strength and combat capability, as they were created to be the perfect war machines. Unable to live in hot area due to high body temperatures, Vanators are dragon like in features, with thick skin, horns, growths, tails, wings and talons.

### Architecture & Camp Concept Sheet

Most of the camps that are near human society are just that; small tiny areas that are scraped together with whatever’s on hand. Since they really don’t require much for survival other than meat and somewhere safe to sleep the night, most of their stuff isn’t permanent, and is meant to be easy to take down if danger ever got too close. The colonies deep in the wilderness though are MASSIVE and much more sturdy. Preferring to live in high locations, most of the colonies are either carved out of mountains where the colony will literally be inside a mountain or a tight pair of cliffs with secret entrances or high up in the trees with easy access to the sky. In the case of the permanent colonies, they are huge, with simple living spaces per Vanator and often surrounding a colony plaza where massive events like training, sparring or festivals occur.

### Culture Concept Sheet

Vanators are divided into Clans, with each Clan having a colony and attempting to improve relations with humans. Each Clan has a Clan leader, and the importance of a Clan is decided by how many good relations they have with humans, and how safe their colony is. One of the main things about their society is that they really have no concept of gender roles or race stereotypes, since they were all built for the same purpose and are thus capable of doing so equally regardless of what they are. Despite being very young, the race has a very strong honor system, with honor and family being the most important things to a Vanator. Humans are a rare sighting in permanent colonies, and the ones that are there are either guests or Honorary Vanators who have earned their title after assisting the colony. There are half humans in their colonies, but again they aren’t ostracized as they often make the best diplomats between humans and Vanators. Because of their very weird anatomy, tight clothing isn’t an option, and they often opt for lightweight tunic like garbs, since staying warm isn’t an issue for them.

### Technology Concept Sheet

Since they’re young and have no foundation for science, whatever technology they have is mostly scrapes they’ve put together and somehow managed to make it work. The Vanators that are scientists are some of the most prized individuals in society, and the technology they produce is often small and lightweight as resources are rather limited.
