Altdorf - Ally of Lorcia. A relatively small country, it is an mining powerhouse thanks to the many mountains that surround and rise in the center of the kingdom. What it lacks in land it makes up with cities built into the mountains, so that the land available can be dedicated to mining or industry while the people reside in the mountains, safe from most attacks. Isolated and rather conservative, Altdorf has a very strong, ancient alliance with Lorcia, as Lorcia assisted Altdorf to break away from Hordwarth. Is ethnically more or less like Scandinavia in our world (pale people).

### Architecture Concept Sheet

The country is very similar to Lorcia in regards to architecture, with Victorian designs. However, given the lack of land, most of the buildings are built into or dug out of the mountains, with much thicker walls and on occasion less complexity in the design.

### Culture Concept Sheet

This country is the MOST conservative out of all the countries, and is by far the most religious. It’s main government is the church council, and the country itself is the center of the world-wide religion, so it comes as no surprise that most people in the country strongly believe in the faith. While the country is stable, it has a very fearful presence, as it also has the Slayers, the church’s equivalent to the inquisition, acting as a standing army.

### Technology

Basically the same as Lorcia, only that they try to make theirs bigger as a way to intimidate enemies and make up for the fact that they are in fact the smallest country in the United Powers.
