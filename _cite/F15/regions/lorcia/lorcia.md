Lorcia is a country of valleys and mountains, with the 3rd largest empire and a people of great diversity. The country’s main export is it’s MASSIVE armies, with all the armies having different generals led by a Head General who obeys the King. Similarly to its ally Aldorf, Lorcia has several mountains, with most of its cities on the face or within the mountain. However, not as many people live within the mountain as Lorcia has several kilometers worth of agricultural land with several populations spread across the empire, allowing for country to balance out industry with agriculture, with the vast majority of its resources hailing from it’s mining ally, Aldorf.

### Architecture Concept Sheet

This country’s architecture is the one that is most similar to Victorian architecture. Since resources and space aren’t much of a concern for the country, Lorcia boasts a lot of gorgeous buildings with complex design, even the ones built into the mountains. A lot of the cities have factories in the outskirts constantly creating products to supply the demand. One thing about the architecture though, and that’s that the military structures are second to none. Since military is very important here, a lot of the military outposts are huge and defensible, often with largest walls encasing the compounds of the HQ’s, with large tunnels going for miles on end.

### Culture Concept Sheet

This culture is surprisingly less conservative than you’d think. Yes, much of the politics is conservative, like monetary spending and foreign policy, but the society itself is more open. Women are allowed more freedoms here than in most countries, with the ability to hold important roles and even be extremely important leaders, with many of the Head Generals or generals of the past being women. The military is the main focus of society, with industry being a close second. The society mimics the Victorian society only that women have more rights and the society is more open to foreign concepts.

### Technology Concept Sheet

This is a country whose technology is more focused on efficiency that on looks. Most of the tech here is bulky, squarish and not particularly pleasing to the eye. That said though, their technology definitely is the sturdiest and takes YEARS for it to finally fall apart. Since military and industry are the country’s main focuses, the technology basically panders to that a lot, with very large figures and impressive firepower.
