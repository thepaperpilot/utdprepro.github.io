The world’s equivalent to India if it was a massive trade empire with the strongest economy in the world. The empire has kept the caste system that has been in place for thousands of years, and while there have been several modernizations to the empire, it still has kept several of its traditional values and standards. Currently it is a massive center of trade, and is economically the strongest country in the world. Ruled by a Sultan and the higher classes, Bharata is a neutral country, acting as an area for a peace talks and world meetings of the United Powers (league of empires sworn to work together). Since it is so large, the skin color varies region to region. The animals of this region are relatively small or lithe or both, given how hot it can be during the day time, and are primarily nocturnal. Most of them are tameable, though there are some creatures under the surface that would have no problem making entire caravans disappear without a trace. The same can be said for the creatures that inhabit the skies and the oceans around them. Some are peaceful or trainable. Others are the stuff of nightmares.

### Architecture Concept Sheet

Architecture is based on more ancient Indian architecture, with very intricate designs, smooth curves and sometimes incorporating the buildings into the pre-existing geography.

### Culture Concept Sheet

Bharata is a TRADE empire, so it has a lot of diversity on its streets and culture, even though India is it’s heaviest influence of culture. It’s very bright, very busy and no matter where you go there’s always an adventure just around the corner. That said, because of it’s trade and it’s need for efficiency, Bharata has a lot of robots everywhere you go, whether they be for cargo or in the case of the upper classes, entertainment/protection.

### Technology Concept Sheet

Given the importance of air and water ports in the empire, most of the technology is a reflection of the forces of nature -weather, water, wind, heat, etc. It also follows a very smooth design that flows and is either minimalist or very intricate depending on how much money the person making or buying it has. For example, a worker in the port might use a very simple looking construct to lower cargo, while a nobleman might be able to afford the most intricate ship money can buy. The main weakness of their technology is that it doesn't fair well in the cold- for this reason, the best airships merchants use are often build in the northernmost city of Bharata where the shipwrights know how to build for cold situations.
