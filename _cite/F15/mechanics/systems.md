### Overarching Systems
Travel

- Open world

- Restrictions on traveling will by placed with in-world/game things/reasons

- Fast travel will be with boats, airships, etc.

Movement

Speed = `min(s * h * ds * b, max*b)`

- `s` = Base land speed

- `h` = hardiness coefficient

- `ds` = decrease in speed due to armour

- `b` = bonus modifier to speed

Jumping

- No mid air direction change

- Speed is affected by armour, jump height is constant

- Fixed jump (no hold for higher jump)

Dialogue Trees

- Morality System

    - Vertical Axis Good/Bad that is universal for all factions

    - Horizontal Axis of Famous/Infamous that is specific on a faction per faction basis

        - Ex. Bandits attack villagers. If you kill all the bandits, you become infamous with the bandits, famous with the villagers, and bad with both.

Inventory/Loot

- Items are limited by weight

- Accessed via menu (not list)

### Combat

Player vs. Enemy AI

Player Specific Combat:

- Like Dragons Dogma ( All specifications )

- "Light Attacks" (Name not Final) is Comboable and Cancellable

- "Heavy Attack/Ability" Non Combable/Canceable

    - After attack player always returns to nuetral state

- Ranged attacks have two modes

    - "Quickfire" launches projectile in direction of movement a set distance

    - "Aiming" draws camera in close and creates reticle

    - Thrown projectiles have fixed distance, arc depends on which way player is facing while aiming

    - Path is not plotted during the throw

- Items used during combat are instantaneous and donâ€™t leave player vulnerable

- Health regen will have a "Soft Cap", where health will regenerate quickly to a certain midpoint, than start regenerating much slower

- Abilities/mechanics are going to be unlocked through narrative progression (Think Legend of Zelda)

- When player is hit they flinch. Flinches make player immobile briefly and small knockback.

    - Flinch is affected by how hard the player is hit and their strength stat.

Mavrock - King

- Tree of Influence - Main system for Mavrock

    - Visualized as a tree whose nodes consist of all characters Mavrock can interact with. It begins with all except a few nodes greyed out.

    - Mavrock can collect bit of information in his journal (some menu type ui). Collecting info on specific characters unlocks that characters node in the tree.

    - When a node in the tree is unlocked, it results in either a new ability for Mavrock (ability to build helper robots in combat, etc.), new dialog options for Mavrock when talking to certain characters (telling guards who are loyal to a noble who under your influence to do an action, etc.), or story progression.

    - The "Influence" bar for Mavrock fills as more nodes in the Tree of Influence are unlocked.
