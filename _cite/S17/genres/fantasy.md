- Rivera starts off as a halfling on a farm; a wizard appears to her and tells her to travel to Royal City and meet with the princess. You must do a fetch quest for the local villagers to defeat the goblin bandits who are blocking the path and retrieve the legendary Sword of Unnecessary Power, which she then keeps.
- In Royal City, Rivera tries to get an audience with the princess but the Captain of the Guard tells you that you need to kill a dungeon beast before you can enter to prove your worth. You enter and do a puzzle battle with a chimera and gain entry.
- You meet with the princess who is your mom. She is being courted by many suitors and knights, and though you try to get her attention, the noise from the suitors drowns you out. Your mom announces that in order to meet with her you must win the joust and so you must sabotage the other suitors to win the joust. Afterwards, you have a tearful reunion with your mom who realizes that fantasy romance is overrated, right as she gets kidnapped by a dragon.
- Rivera travels to the dragonâ€™s lair and slays the dragon in a puzzle battle. Mom rescued, you return to the real world.
