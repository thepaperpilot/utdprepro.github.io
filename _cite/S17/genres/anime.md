- She gets accosted by the class president who tells her she must get more involved and forces her participate in the school festival by filling in for an injured sports team member on every team (who her brother hurt by accident). In order to “power up”, she must make friends on each team who then carry her through the challenges through the power of friendship.
- She confronts her brother about his reckless behavior- he refuses to listen to her and they both hear news of a kaiju attack on the city headed towards the school. Her brother runs off to pilot a mech- she must use a necklace from the adventure genre to transform into a magical girl and fly off after him.
- The kaiju attacks the school’s upper floors where her brother is piloting a mech; however a risky move on his part fails and ends up destroying his mech. Rivera must rescue her brother and also kill the kaiju before returning home.
