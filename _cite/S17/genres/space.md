- Rivera finds herself staring out a large window into space, the mansion having become a large spaceship. A crewmember taps her shoulder, saying that they’re almost to their destination, Moonbase Lambda Omega Lambda. Suddenly the PA system starts up, reporting a situation on the bridge requiring all new recruits to report. Rivera hurries over and finds her dad being accosted by the rest of the crew and demanding to see their manager. He is sent to a cell aboard the ship and though Rivera tries to argue with them she is still too low a rank soldier to have any real authority. She must prove her worth by completing the mission on the moonbase, which is to repair the gravity field generator. She does well, ranking up from recruit to cadet, but it’s not enough to free her father.
- Before reaching the next mission, the ship is ambushed by space pirates. While Rivera is completing puzzles to shut down the airlocks, she receives news that the pirates have breached the hold and have taken her father. She runs over just to see her father calmly going along with the pirates, glad to finally be getting some fresh air around here. She and a few other cadets cross the ship to take him back (something about no man being left behind), and they must perform a stealth-style puzzle to retrieve him. After accosting the pirate captain she is promoted to corporal and is finally given responsibility over her dad. Before she can leave with him, he accidentally mistakes an escape pod for an elevator to his new quarters and gets launched onto an abandoned planet possibly crawling with hostiles next to a black hole which may destroy the planet. However they are unable to to run after him immediately because of the damage done to the ship during the raid.
- Rivera leads an elite squad of soldiers to rescue her dad. They find the crash landed escape pod on the surface. The land is extremely unstable thanks to its proximity to the blackhole(more dropping platforms, funky gravity). She tracks her dad into an abandoned facility where it appears a monster has corrupted the base. The alien is weak to sunlight, therefore she and the soldiers bring down the roof to expose the alien and kill it. Turns out her dad was locked in an outhouse the whole time. After a successful mission they beam out and Rivera and her dad return to reality.
