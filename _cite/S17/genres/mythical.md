- Rivera wakes up in a glade of trees, where an angel appears to her, saying that she is a demigod and has been selected by one of the gods to be her champion. She is whisked away to Temple of the Heavens (the mansion) and is greeted by all of the gods. Most of them have chosen a mighty hulking warrior as their champion but the goddess of wisdom has instead chosen Rivera. They are tasked with the challenge of defeating the giants who are building a tower to the heavens to challenge the gods, but they doubt her capability. She must prove herself by making it through the minotaur’s labyrinth using her wits(the basement).
- Successful, both she and the warrior are sent out to fight the beasts that terrorize the humans on earth. While the warrior hacks away at the beasts, Rivera notices that they only attack at night and they are afraid of light, and that the people do not have fire. She must collect fire from the giant’s camp in a stealth mission and give it to the humans who are now able to defend themselves. Pleased, the goddess of wisdom grants her a number of magic artifacts to help her with her final quest: a chalice that is filled with an elixir of temporary invincibility when refilled with water, a book containing a powerful spell that lets her astral project, and a mirror shield.
- Her final job is to climb the tower using her mythical artifacts and defeat the giants at the top. At their defeat, the warrior who the other gods had championed becomes jealous and attacks, prompting a puzzle battle where you use the tower’s construction equipment to trap him.
