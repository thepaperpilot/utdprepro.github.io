- Rivera wakes up in a bunker and finds that she’s part of a society of survivors of a terrible apocalypse involving zombies, nuclear war, and a corrupt government. This also the day the Selection to choose who will participate in the Trial of the Wastes. She sees her sister get selected and you are barred from leaving by a vault gate. Rivera must hack her way out and follow them into the wastes.
- The first trial of the wastes involves getting past the city ruins which are crawling with zombies. Her sister and her fellow teenage protagonists easily clear this section except for the obvious minor character. This becomes a platforming challenge for Rivera as she must hop across the crowd of zombies. (The floor is lava but zombies)
- The second trial is to get through the radioactive desert full of bandits on motorbikes. Her sister has already cleared this section but she has no idea of where to go and so must solve a puzzle to lead her the right way (desert maze)
- The final part involves freeing your sister as she and her comrades have passed the trials and are therefore “prime candidates for experimentation.” Rivera must enter the Integral and defeat the derivatives who are the corrupt government agents. Despite the friends she has made and being the part of the heroine, her sister decides that she’d rather spend time with her family and leaves.
