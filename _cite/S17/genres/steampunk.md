- Finding herself in the Oxbridge Institute of Science and Engineering, Rivera becomes a chimneysweep in the building. Though the Institute is the leading center of robot technologies and alchemy, recently thereâ€™s been a number of unexplained disappearance of students. In the day (while steampunk is in play), she is asked by the Dean (her grandpa) to act as his eyes and find some clues. As a man who hates leaving a mystery unsolved, he does not want to return until this case is closed. At night (when gothic is in play), she spots a vampire and follows it to a locked door. In the day she solves the lock to it (a steam/clockwork puzzle) and inside she spots the missing students, but they are hooked up to pods that are draining their life energy. They are rescued but unconscious, and in the corner of her eye, Rivera spots the vampire slink away to the corner.
- When she returns to the Institute, the Dean is worried since all the gear that they found in the locked chamber had gone missing before they could investigate it. During the day and night at first, Rivera must look for clues and find out which professor is the vampire. The steampunk way to defeat him is by setting up mirrors all over the campus to redirect sunlight so that at the right moment the professor is incinerated; the other method is to drink a potion from the alchemy lab that temporarily converts Rivera into a werewolf so that she can confront the vampire and trap him by cutting down iron cages. Mystery solved, her grandpa is satisfied and returns with her.
