- Rivera is on a caravel (the mansion) and she is trapped in the crow’s nest with a fellow exploration expedition member, who watches with you as pirates seize the deck and go below to round up the rest of your crew. You must swing on ropes and cut them to knock pirates off the ship or knock them unconscious. You go below deck and find that your crew has already dealt with the pirates so you can continue your quest: find the lost relic inside a jungle temple. You must avoid setting off traps or running away from them. At the chamber you must pick the correct key using logic and clues on the temple wall and retrieve the idol.
- Next expedition they travel to the far east to retrieve an ancient sword that has fallen into the hands of an assassin clan. Your job is to infiltrate through stealth the clan’s headquarters in a trading port manor and retrieve it. At its retrieval, the sword turns out to be cursed and you and your group enter a parkour dream world where if you die you die in real-life as a test of worth. You and your team live, and the assassins, seeing as you passed the sword’s test, lets you leave with it.
- Your team heads back to an American port to take a train back to your city to place the two artifacts in the museum. However, the train is attacked by bandits and you must solve a number train puzzles to first free the train of robbers and reach the engine room, then do a rail puzzle to make sure that the train does not crash by using a whip to pull levers.
