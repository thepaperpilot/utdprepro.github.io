Each genre has its own aesthetic; some genre maps can be larger or smaller than others, but in general each room’s layout stays similar across genres. Overall, while within books, artists can stylize and play off the book/paper theme as much as they want.

- The Real World: The mansion in which players must navigate is an antebellum-style mansion, aged but still well-kept. Features natural lighting and everything you would typically expect at your grandma’s house. Feels homey and warm, even when your family goes missing.
- Mythology: Main motifs are that of Greco-Roman, Persian, and Egyptian; the mansion is colored like papyrus and has a desaturated yellow tint to it. Shading and outlines have some noise, resembling faded ink. NPCs include centaurs, nature spirits, and gods; the mansion somewhat resembles an ancient temple.
- Fantasy: Tolkien-esque world with medieval European influences (Celtic/Viking/Frankish). The environment should evoke the sublime- awe-inspiring structures, dramatic lighting, but subdued colors. Elves, dwarves, and orcs act as NPCs; parts of the mansion look like a castle.
- Adventure: The most hodgepodge genre, featuring high contrast, bold colors and lighting. The mansion transforms into a pirate ship which can travel between an Mesoamerican jungle, an East Asian port, and the Wild West..
- Steampunk/Gothic:The mansion becomes an academy in industrial England; structures and items that look fine in the day become creepy and distorted in the night. Technology features strongly when it is bright outside, colorful; more supernatural things appear in the desaturated darkness. Overall color tint is sepia.
- Noir/Atomic: Everything is black and white, grainy like old-time film. The mansion becomes a 1920’s style ritzy hotel in the city; featuring suits and such. Combines later Americana styles with art deco. NPCs are humans like club goers, the mafia, and a nuclear suburban family.
- Anime/Manga: A world heavily based off of modern Japan though with increased instances of absurdity. The mansion becomes a high school, for which you are late to the first day of. Shading is flatter and outlines are thin; coloring is similar to that of watercolors. Features magical girls, kaiju, cherry blossoms blowing in the wind, and pointy chins.
- Superhero: A bright, modern/near-futuristic city where the mansion becomes a superhero headquarters. Everything is outlined in bold black while items are colored in halftones like in comic books. On occasion, one can see sound effects in bubbles. Include humans, though a few may be aliens or mythical creatures.
- Dystopia/Post-Apocalyptic: Colors are desaturated and dull. The mansion is a crumbling safehouse at the edge of a ruined city in a wasteland. Features graffiti, Mad Max style vehicles, zombies, and a ripoff Hunger Games.
- Space Opera: The mansion transforms into a spaceship flying through the galaxy. Everything is sleek and futuristic; lighting is most likely going to be blue, purple, and white. NPCs can be humans and aliens, and like in the adventure world you can land on a moon base and an alien planet.
