A grizzled elderly man, eager to help Val and Pelas... by forcing them to do things for themselves. His tough love approach to teaching is intended to help the kids grow in Courage, though results can end up mixed. If you are stuck, he MIGHT drop hints as to what to do, otherwise heâ€™ll let you figure out for yourself.
