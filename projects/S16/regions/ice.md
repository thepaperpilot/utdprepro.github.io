An isolated and often judgmental tribe that lives according to strict principles. They work often for their own subsistence, hunting and logging and fishing; having to exchange goods and services enacts an honor system amongst them, something they are bound by. A deep seated fear of being wrong means that tribesmen are perfectionists and unwilling to admit they are wrong, a stubborn attitude that allows them to survive in the harsh landscape.
