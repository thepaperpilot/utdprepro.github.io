In the volcanic region of Limbo, itâ€™s kill or be killed, and the Fire Tribe does its best to protect itself against spirits and the land itself. Though its members do manage to eke out a home life farming the fertile soil and mining, the most awaited moment comes when a tribe member comes of age and joins the military, displaying courage in the face of dangerous beasts and spirits. Hiding emotion and turmoil for the sake of bravado, they tend to be very temperamental and violent when provoked.
