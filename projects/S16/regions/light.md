title: Light Region
cards: [Light Region, Desert Concept]
---
The desert, being as barren as it is, is nonetheless filled with the laughs and awestruck voices of the Light Tribe. They enjoy the little things in life, being thankful and in wonder in every opportunity they are given. A sad moment in life is the last thing any tribesman would want, but entire life’s worth of covering up bad experiences has left even the tribe’s most experienced farmers and artisans, to be quite frank, childish and naive and unable to make judicious choices.
