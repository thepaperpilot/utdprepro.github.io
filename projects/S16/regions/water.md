A tribe that seeks to archive, experiment, and explore everything there is to be known. By figuring out how Limbo works, then perhaps their tribe would not be caught unawares and left helpless- thus the great scientists and explorers of the Water Tribe continue to compile science, history, and everything else in the Grand Library. Their sheer focus on research has however left them with little desire to use what they learned or do anything else- Water tribesmen are loathed to sacrifice both time and resources to others, doing just enough to keep themselves and their research alive.
