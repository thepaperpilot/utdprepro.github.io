Within the toxic fungal swamps, the Dark tribe thrives. Practically everything here is dangerous, and hostile spirits lurk about, prompting the clan to trust in one another for survival. Tribesmen are anxious about support or security, and build support groups and are prepared for nearly everything. Nevertheless, their tendency to lean towards extreme paranoia leads them to be either very clingy or quick to abandon new relationships.
