Possible Party Companion for Mavrock. Razeth is the daughter of a Clan Leader in Marvansk, having been raised to understand the importance of human-Vanator alliances as she herself is the result of a human and a Vanator. Due to the recent rise in dislike for Vanators as well as tensions, she has been sent by the Clans to talk to Mavrock and attempt to solidify a workable alliance with him.
