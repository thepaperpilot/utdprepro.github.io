Mother of Grace. Natalie always placed all the expectations of family on Grace, and raised her to be like her; a strategizing mind with no mercy. When Grace left the family after being fed up with her motherâ€™s overbearing cruel ways, Natalie swore to someday force her daughter to crawl back to her. After having lost her leg in battle, she is now Minister of Military and definitely knows how to use the power as the Ex-General of all Armies.
