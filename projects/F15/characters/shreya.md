Possible Party Member for Grace. A high standing noble from Bharata, Shreya was raised to carry on the family name and is used to being treated as if her opinion didn’t matter as her family usually decided things for her. Now that she has left that life behind and is in Lorcia with Grace, she’s quickly learning that the world is a harsh place but that working through it is what makes life an adventure.
