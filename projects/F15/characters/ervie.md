The woman who was the nanny to Mavrock and didn’t go insane in the attempt. A very kindhearted woman, she raised Mavrock and has been a mother to him in every sense of the word. It’s thanks to her that he’s not entirely devoid of emotion or passion; she’s the sort of person who can find a humanizing emotion in even the most devious of people. Currently is the nanny to Mavrock’s younger sister Lilia.
