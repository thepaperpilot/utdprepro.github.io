One of the four playable heroes.

The black brigade is Lorciaâ€™s greatest military force, answering only to the king rather than to the council of generals, and it makes sense that one of its 3 founders, Vester, is as equally intense as the Brigade itself. Coming from a long line of generals, she broke away from the family after her mother and she had a falling out, causing her to focus even harder on doing better than her mother. In the beginning, she, James and Henrick founded the Brigade while they were in military academy, and upon its official creation under the king, Grace has become its commander, with James as her 2nd in command and Henrick as the hand to the king (long story). While her strongest point is strategizing, she also has to interact with multiple ministers to deal with war plans and budget issues.
