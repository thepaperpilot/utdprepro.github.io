One of the four playable heroes.

King of the frozen country Marvansk. As the most politically powerful character in the entire game, he knows how to manipulate and how to do it well. Raised to be a king, he knows how to carry himself and has an air of arrogance to him. Everything he owns is of the highest quality, and he is used to getting what he wants and having it to the maximum quality. Due to his country’s need for science to survive, he himself has some mastery in science, especially in the areas of electro-magnetism, so that’s another area of arrogance he has. Typically he wears the colors of his country, white and blue, and is the sort who prefers to look sharp at all times. Given his position and his abilities as a scientist, the rare few times he is in battle, he shows off as much as possible.
