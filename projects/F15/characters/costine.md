One of the four playable heroes.

The 2nd original ever created, Costine is almost 200 years old, having seen her people rise and fall throughout the ages. Her race is that of the Vanators, winged beings created by Rolf Vladimir to be monsters used in battle, capable of shattering steel with their bare hands and surviving in the coldest of temperatures. Draconian in design, the Vanators all have leathery-scaley skin, thicker than the average human’s, and their legs are something akin to legs you’d find on a large lizard, talons and all. Massive creatures, Vanators are built like bricks and are capable of taking heavy damage and tearing through ships if necessary. Because she is an Original, she and the other Originals have more mutations than the others of their race, ranging from color, number of eyes, number of limbs and wing, abilities, etc. Vanators also have growths on them that can act as plating and armor, which can be filed down into a form that best suits that Vanator, as well as horns that vary from each individual. All Vanators have 2 abilities, a passive and an aggressive.
