The BBEG.

Pierce. The Hated 11th. The Originals once had an 11th member, the youngest of them all named Pierce. Pierce was the last Original created, and thus the one with least amount of mutations and imperfections, so much so that Vladimir had trained him to be his successor in a worst case scenario. After getting his wings clipped and exiled into the wilderness, he wandered in Hellion, a country desperate for scientific discovery. When he presented himself to the king as a scientist, the king gave him a chance to prove his worth. Over the years he did; genetically improved crops, cattle, animals, etc, each time gaining more and more power. Eventually he started working on humans and eventually conquered the entire country, converting most of the people into mindless monsters obedient to only him. In order to give himself time to build up forces, Pierce allowed the rest of the world to think Helyon was the same as ever, never letting them find about what he had done. Until now. And now, he wants vengeance.
