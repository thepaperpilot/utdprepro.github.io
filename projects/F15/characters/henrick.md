Giver of missions to Grace. The hand to the king and advisor on war plans, Henrick is an old friend of Grace’s as they created the Black Brigade together along with Grace’s 2nd in command James. After becoming Advisor to King, he has settled down with a family and has not really seen combat in a while. He is doing his best to ensure that Lorcia has no fears of invasion and that the army branches are all working in unity rather than against each other.
