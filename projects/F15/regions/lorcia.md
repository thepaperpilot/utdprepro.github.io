Lorcia is a country of valleys and mountains, with the 3rd largest empire and a people of great diversity. The country’s main export is it’s MASSIVE armies, with all the armies having different generals led by a Head General who obeys the King. Similarly to its ally Aldorf, Lorcia has several mountains, with most of its cities on the face or within the mountain. However, not as many people live within the mountain as Lorcia has several kilometers worth of agricultural land with several populations spread across the empire, allowing for country to balance out industry with agriculture, with the vast majority of its resources hailing from it’s mining ally, Aldorf.
