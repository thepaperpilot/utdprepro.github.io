Vanators don’t have official countries, living in colonies around human society or deep in the wilderness where humans don’t dare go near. A rather young race, what they lack of worldly knowledge or politics they more than make up for in sheer strength and combat capability, as they were created to be the perfect war machines. Unable to live in hot area due to high body temperatures, Vanators are dragon like in features, with thick skin, horns, growths, tails, wings and talons.
