Altdorf - Ally of Lorcia. A relatively small country, it is an mining powerhouse thanks to the many mountains that surround and rise in the center of the kingdom. What it lacks in land it makes up with cities built into the mountains, so that the land available can be dedicated to mining or industry while the people reside in the mountains, safe from most attacks. Isolated and rather conservative, Altdorf has a very strong, ancient alliance with Lorcia, as Lorcia assisted Altdorf to break away from Hordwarth. Is ethnically more or less like Scandinavia in our world (pale people).
