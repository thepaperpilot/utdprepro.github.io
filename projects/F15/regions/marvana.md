A MASSIVE country in the North, it consists of multiple small cities isolated in an icy tundra filled with lethal beasts and predators that can wipe entire cities off of maps during certain feeding months. Because of this, most of civilization lives in bubbles on the sides of mountains and underground, where their science is unparalleled thanks to having to adapt so often to the dangers the tundra offers. Their royal family has a long bloody history with Fayer, a country bordering them to the South that throughout history has forced them to pay extremely high tax to pass their goods through there, causing them to have a series of wars and conquering races to get at the other. Because Marzanna has so much lethal fauna, the society has incorporated some of them into their society, primarily war bears (think enormous 6-legged armored bears you can ride into battle) and other large animals to help with transportation, protection, and multiple other services.
