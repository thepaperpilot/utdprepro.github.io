The worldâ€™s equivalent to India if it was a massive trade empire with the strongest economy in the world. The empire has kept the caste system that has been in place for thousands of years, and while there have been several modernizations to the empire, it still has kept several of its traditional values and standards. Currently it is a massive center of trade, and is economically the strongest country in the world. Ruled by a Sultan and the higher classes, Bharata is a neutral country, acting as an area for a peace talks and world meetings of the United Powers (league of empires sworn to work together). Since it is so large, the skin color varies region to region. The animals of this region are relatively small or lithe or both, given how hot it can be during the day time, and are primarily nocturnal. Most of them are tameable, though there are some creatures under the surface that would have no problem making entire caravans disappear without a trace. The same can be said for the creatures that inhabit the skies and the oceans around them. Some are peaceful or trainable. Others are the stuff of nightmares.
