4 people, 4 countries, each one suffering from a different class of problems, yet all are intertwined. 1 commands an elite squad, loyal to the king to the bitter end. 1 is king of a frozen city in wind and frost. 1 is a traveling merchant, exploring the world for the first time. And 1 fights to prevent the extinction of their very race. Their stories will cross and mingle, and the outcome could very end with the fall of another. This is War.

Play as 1 of 4 heroes, each with differing abilities, and explore the world through their eyes as they struggle to keep their countries and people afloat. Combat opponents in battle and debate, as you strike down and manipulate each of your foes. Establish alliances, break them, romance characters, and explore all the alternate possibilities for the ending. You are the hero.
